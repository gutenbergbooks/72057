<small>TURFING IT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A thin</span> wisp of smoke drifted up from the camp at the
edge of the wash. It rose languidly, as though affected
by the fact that the day was going to be a scorcher.
Already, though the morning was young, a fiery sun
beat down on the sand so that heat waves shimmered
in the air. Occasionally a spark from the crackling cottonwood
limbs was caught by a dust whirl and carried
toward the field of ripe wheat bordering the creek.</p>

<p>Of the campers there were three, all of the genus
tramp, but each a variant. They represented different
types, these desert trekkers.</p>

<p>The gross man lying lazily under the shade of a
clump of willows might have stepped straight out of a
vaudeville sketch. He was dirty and unkempt, his face
bloated and dissipated. From his lax mouth projected
an English brier pipe, uncleansably soiled. His clothes
hung on him like sacks, wrinkled and dusty, but not
ragged. He was too good a hobo to wear anything
torn or patched. It was his boast that he could get
another suit for the asking any time he needed one.</p>

<p>“I’m a blowed-in-the-glass stiff,” he bragged now.
“Drilled from Denver to ’Frisco fifteen times, an’ never
was a stake man or a shovel bum. Not for a day, ’boes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Ask any o’ the push about old York. They’ll give it to
youse straight that he knows the best flops from Cincie
to Phillie, an’ that no horstile crew can ditch him when
he’s goin’ good.”</p>

<p>York was a hobo pure and simple. It was his business
in life. For “stew-bums” and “gay-cats,” to use his
own phraseology, he had a supreme contempt. His companions
were amateurs, from his point of view non-professionals.
Neither of them had any pride in turfing it,
which is the blanket stiff’s expression for taking to the
road. They did not understand York’s vocabulary nor
the ethics that were current in his craft.</p>

<p>Yet the thin, weasel-faced man with the cigarette
drooping from his mouth was no amateur in his own
line. He had a prison face, the peculiar distortion of one
side of the mouth often seen in confirmed criminals.
His light-blue eyes were cold and dead. A film veiled
them and snuffed out all expression.</p>

<p>“Cig” he called himself, and the name sufficed. On
the road surnames were neither asked for nor volunteered.
York had sized him up three days before when
they had met at Colorado Springs, and he had passed
on his verdict to the third member of the party.</p>

<p>“A river rat on a vac—hittin’ the grit for a getaway,”
he had whispered.</p>

<p>His guess had been a good one. Cig had been brought
up on the East River. He had served time in the penitentiaries
of three States and expected to test the hospitality
of others. Just now he was moving westward
because the East was too hot for him. He and a pal had
done a job at Jersey City during which they had been
forced to croak a guy. Hence his unwilling expedition
to the Rockies. Never before had he been farther from
the Atlantic than Buffalo, and the vast uninhabited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
stretches of the West bored and appalled him. He
was homesick for the fetid dumps of New York.</p>

<p>The corner of his mouth lifted in a sneer. “Wot’ell
would any one want to cross this Gawd-forsaken country
fifteen times for unless he was bughouse?”</p>

<p>“If you read the papes you’d know that travel is a
lib’ral ejucation. Difference between a man an’ a tree is
that one’s got legs to move around with. You ginks on
the East Side act like you’re anchored to the Batt’ry
an’ the Bowery. Me, I was born there, but I been batterin’
on the road ever since I was knee-high to a duck.
A fellow’s got to throw his feet if he wants to learn,”
York announced dogmatically.</p>

<p>There was obvious insult in Cig’s half-closed eyes.
“’S at what learned you all youse know?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t get heavy, young feller,” advised the blanket
stiff. “I’ve knew guys to stay healthy by layin’ off
me.”</p>

<p>The young man cooking breakfast barked a summons.
“Come an’ get it.”</p>

<p>The tramps moved forward to eat, forgetting for the
moment their incipient quarrel. Into tin cups and plates
the cook poured coffee and stew. In his light clean build,
slender but well-packed, was the promise of the athlete.
His movements disappointed this expectation. He
slouched, dragging the worn shoes through the cracks
of which the flesh was visible. Of the three, he was the
only one that was ragged. The coat he wore, which did
not match the trousers, was at the last extremity.</p>

<p>One might have guessed his age at twenty-three or
four. If it had not been for the sullen expression in the
eyes and the smoldering discontent of the face, he might
have been good-looking. The reddish hair was short,
crisp, and curly, the eyes blue as the Colorado summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
sky above, the small head well-shaped and beautifully
poised on the sloping column of the neck.</p>

<p>Yet the impression he made on observers was not a
pleasant one. His good points were marred by the spirit
that found outlet in a sullen manner that habitually
grudged the world a smile. He had the skin pigment of
the blond, and in the untempered sun of the Rockies
should have been tanned to a rich red-brown. Instead,
the skin was clammily unhealthy. The eyes were dulled
and expressionless.</p>

<p>York ate wolfishly, occasionally using the sleeve of
his coat for a napkin. He talked, blatantly and continuously.
Cig spoke only at rare intervals, the cook not at
all. Within the silent man there simmered a nausea of
disgust that included himself and all the universe in
which he moved.</p>

<p>In the underworld caste rules more rigidly than in upper
strata of society. The sense of superiority is everywhere
an admission of weakness. It is the defense of
one who lives in a glass house. Since all of these men
were failures, each despised the others and cherished
his feeling that they were inferior.</p>

<p>“You ’boes turf it with York an’ you’ll always have
plenty o’ punk and plaster,” the old tramp swaggered.
“Comes to batterin’ I’m there with bells on.”</p>

<p>Translated into English, he meant that if they traveled
with him they would have bread and butter enough
because he was a first-class beggar.</p>

<p>“To hear youse chew the rag you’re a wiz, ain’t
you?” Cig jeered. “I ain’t noticed you diggin’ up any
Ritz-Carlton lunches a guy can write home about. How
about it, Tug?”</p>

<p>The cook grunted.</p>

<p>“Me, I can tell a mark far as I can see him—know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
whether he’s good for a flop or a feed,” York continued.
“Onct I was ridin’ the rods into Omaha—been punchin’
the wind till I was froze stiff, me ’n’ a pal called
Seattle. Shacks an’ the con tried to ditch us. Nothin’
doing. We was right there again when the wheels began
to move. In the yards at Omaha we bumps into a gay-cat—like
Tug here. He spills the dope that the bulls
are layin’ for us. Some mission stiff had beefed on me.
No guy with or without brass buttons can throw a
scare into old York. No can do. So I says to Seattle,
says I—”</p>

<p>York’s story died in his throat. He stood staring,
mouth open and chin fallen.</p>

<p>Two men were standing on the edge of the bluff above
the bed of the creek. He did not need a second look to
tell him that they had come to make trouble.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>“DE KING O’ PROOSHIA ON DE JOB”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> Reed came his foreman Lon Forbes with a story of
three tramps camping down by Willow Creek close to
the lower meadow wheatfield.</p>

<p>The ranchman made no comment, unless it was one
to say, “Get out the car.” He was a tight-lipped man of
few words, sometimes grim. His manner gave an effect
of quiet strength.</p>

<p>Presently the two were following the winding road
through the pasture. A field of golden wheat lay below
them undulating with the roll of the land. Through it
swept the faintest ripple of quivering grain. The crop
was a heavy one, ripe for the reaper. Dry as tinder, a
spark might set a blaze running across the meadow like
wildfire.</p>

<p>Forbes pointed the finger of a gnarled hand toward a
veil of smoke drifting lazily from the wash. “Down
there, looks like.”</p>

<p>His employer nodded. They descended from the car
and walked along the edge of the bank above the creek
bed. Three men sat near a camp-fire. One glance was
enough to show that they were hoboes. Coffee in an
old tomato can was bubbling over some live coals set
between two flat stones.</p>

<p>The big man with the bloated face was talking. The
others were sulkily silent, not so much listening as offering
an annoyed refusal to be impressed. The boaster
looked up, and the vaporings died within him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“What you doing here?” demanded Reed. His voice
was curt and hostile.</p>

<p>York, true to type, became at once obsequious. “No
offense, boss. If these here are private grounds—”</p>

<p>“They are,” the owner cut in sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll hit the grit right away. No harm done,
mister.” The voice of the blanket stiff had become a
whine, sullen and yet fawning.</p>

<p>His manner irritated both of his companions. Cig
spoke first, out of the corner of his mouth, slanting an
insolent look up at the ranchman.</p>

<p>“Youse de traffic cop on dis block, mister?”</p>

<p>Lon Forbes answered. “We know your sort an’
don’t want ’em here. Shack! Hit the trail pronto! No
back talk about it either.”</p>

<p>Cig looked at the big foreman. “Gawd!” he jeered.
“Wotcha know about that? De king o’ Prooshia on de
job again.”</p>

<p>The bluff tanned Westerner took a step or two toward
the ferret-faced man from the slums. Hurriedly York
spoke up. He did not want anything “started.” There
were stories current on the road of what ranchmen had
done to hoboes who had made trouble. He knew of one
who had insulted a woman and had been roped and
dragged at a horse’s heels till half dead.</p>

<p>“We ain’t doin’ no harm, boss. But we’ll beat it ’f
you say so. Gotta roll up our war bags.”</p>

<p>Reed did not discuss the question of the harm they
were doing. He knew that a spark might ignite the
wheat, but he did not care to plant the suggestion in
their minds. “Put out the fire and move on,” he said
harshly.</p>

<p>“De king o’ Prooshia an’ de clown prince,” Cig retorted
with a lift of his lip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>But he shuffled forward and began to kick dirt over
the fire with the toe of his shoe.</p>

<p>Reed turned to the youngest tramp. “Get water in
that can,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“I don’ know about that.” Up till now the tramp
called Tug had not said a word. “I’m not your slave.
Get water yourself if you want to. Able-bodied, ain’t
you?”</p>

<p>The rancher looked steadily at him, and the longer
he looked, the less he liked what he saw. A stiff beard
bristled on the sullen face of the tramp. He was ragged
and disreputable from head to heel. In the dogged eyes,
in straddling legs, in the half-clenched fist resting on
one hip, Reed read defiance. The gorge of the Westerner
rose. The country was calling for men to get in its
harvests. His own crops were ripe and he was short of
hands. Yet this husky young fellow was a loafer. He
probably would not do a day’s work if it were offered
him. He was a parasite, the kind of ne’er-do-well who
declines to saw wood for a breakfast, metaphorically
speaking.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk back to me. Do as I say. Then get out of
here.”</p>

<p>Reed did not lift his voice. It was not necessary. As
he stood on the bank above the sand bed he conveyed
an impression of strength in every line of his solid body.
Even the corduroy trousers he wore folded into the
short laced boots seemed to have fallen into wrinkles
that expressed power. Close to fifty, the sap of virile
energy still flowed in his veins.</p>

<p>The fist on Tug’s hip clenched. He flushed angrily.
“Kind of a local God Almighty on tin wheels,” he said
with a sneer.</p>

<p>York was rolling up his pack. Cig, grumbling, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
begun to gather his belongings. But the youngest
tramp gave no evidence of an intention to leave. Nor
did he make a move to get water to put out the still
smoldering fire.</p>

<p>The rancher came down from the bank. Forbes was
at his elbow. The foreman knew the signs of old. Reed
was angry. Naturally imperious, he did not allow any
discussion when clearly within his rights. He would not
waste his force on such a spineless creature as York, but
the youngest tramp was of a different sort. He needed
a lesson, and Lon judged he was about to get one.</p>

<p>“Hear me? Get water and douse that fire,” the
ranchman said.</p>

<p>His steel-gray eyes were fastened to those of Tug.
The tramp faced him steadily. Forbes had a momentary
surprise. This young fellow with the pallid dead skin
looked as though he would not ask for anything better
than a fight.</p>

<p>“Get it yourself,” the hobo flung back.</p>

<p>The right fist of the ranchman lifted swiftly. It did
not move far, but it carried great power back of it. The
tramp’s head snapped backward. His shoulders hit
the sand. He had been caught on the point of the jaw
by a knock-out punch.</p>

<p>Tug came back to consciousness under the impression
that he was drowning in deep waters. Cig was dipping
a can in the creek and sousing its contents over his head.
He sat up dizzily. His uncertain gaze fell on some one
who had arrived since his exit from activity.</p>

<p>She was a young woman on horseback. He noticed
that she was slender and had a good seat. Her dark eyes
watched him.</p>

<p>Who was she? What the dickens was she doing here?
Where was he anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>His glance swept the scene. York was stamping out
the last embers of the fire. There was a bruise on Cig’s
cheek and one of his eyes was rapidly closing. From the
fact that Forbes was examining abraded knuckles it
was an easy guess that he had been in action.</p>

<p>The rancher, hands in coat pockets, relieved his
mind in regard to the youth he had knocked out.
“You’re a good-for-nothing loafer, not fit to live in a
country that treats you too well. If I had charge of
wastrels like you, I’d put you on the rock-pile and work
you to a frazzle. What use are you, to yourself or any
one else? When you were needed to fill a uniform,
I’ll bet a dollar you were a slacker. You still are. A
worthless, rotten-to-the-core hobo. Now get up and
get off my land or I’ll give you that thrashing you
need.”</p>

<p>Tug got up, swayed unsteadily on his feet, and
lurched forward. In his eyes, still dull and glazed from
the shock his nervous system had endured, a gleam of
anger came to life. He was a slacker, was he? All right.
He would show this arrogant slave-driver that he could
stand up and take all he had to give.</p>

<p>His rush was a poor leaden-footed shuffle, for he was
shaky at the knees and weights dragged at his feet. The
blow he aimed at Reed missed the brown face half a
foot. It was badly timed and placed. The ranchman’s
counter caught him flush on the cheekbone and flung
him back.</p>

<p>Again he gathered himself and plunged forward.
Clinton Reed belonged to the old fighting West. He
had passed through the rip-roaring days of Leadville’s
prime and later had been a part of Cripple Creek’s turbid
life. Always he had been a man of his hands. He
punished his dazed opponent with clean hard blows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
most of them started at short range to save his own
fists from the chance of broken or dislocated bones.</p>

<p>The tramp fell into a clinch to get time for recovery.
Reed jolted him out of it with a short arm left below
the chin and followed with two slashing rights to
the face.</p>

<p>The hobo was in a bad way. In ring parlance, he was
what is known as groggy. His arms moved slowly and
without force back of the blows. His knees sagged.
There was a ringing in his head. He did not seem able
to think clearly.</p>

<p>But the will in him functioned to push him to more
punishment. He attacked feebly. Through a weak defense
the ranchman’s driving arms tore cruelly.</p>

<p>Tug went down again. He tried to rise, but in spite of
the best he could do was unable to get up. The muscles
of the legs would not coöperate with the will.</p>

<p>Some one in khaki riding-breeches flashed past him.
“That’s enough, Dad. I don’t care if he was impudent.
You’ve hurt him enough. Let him go now.”</p>

<p>The figure was the boyish one of the equestrienne, but
the high indignant voice was feminine enough.</p>

<p>“S’pose you try minding your own business, Bess,”
her father said quietly.</p>

<p>“Now, Dad,” she expostulated. “We don’t want
any trouble, do we? Make ’em move on, and that’s
enough.”</p>

<p>“Tha’s what we’re doin’, Betty,” explained the
foreman. “It ain’t our fault if there’s a rookus. We
told ’em to light out, an’ they got sassy.”</p>

<p>Tug rose with difficulty. He was a badly hammered
hobo. Out of swollen and discolored eyes he looked at
the ranchman.</p>

<p>“You quite through with me?” he snarled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>It was a last growl of defiance. His companions were
already clambering with their packs out of the wash
to the bank above.</p>

<p>“Not quite.” Clint Reed took his daughter by the
shoulders and spun her out of the way when she tried
to stop him. “Be fresh if you want to, my young wobbly.
I reckon I can stand it if you can.” He whirled
the tramp round and kicked him away.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad! Fighting with a tramp,” the girl wailed.</p>

<p>Tug swung round unsteadily, eyes blazing. He took
a step toward the rancher. His glance fell on the girl
who had just called him a tramp, and in saying it had
chosen the last word of scorn. Her troubled, disdainful
gaze met his fully. The effect on him was odd. It paralyzed
action. He stopped, breathing hard.</p>

<p>She had called him a tramp, as one who belongs to
another world might do—a world that holds to self-respect
and decency. He had read in her voice utter and
complete contempt for the thing he was. It was a bitter
moment. For him it stamped the low-water mark of his
degradation. He felt beneath her eyes a thing unclean.</p>

<p>What she had said was true. He was a tramp. He had
ridden the rods, asked for hand-outs, rough-housed with
hoboes, slept with them. He had just been thoroughly
thrashed and kicked before her. What was the use of
resenting it? He had become declassed. Why should he
not be kicked and beaten? That was the customary way
to treat his kind of cattle.</p>

<p>Tug swung heavily on a heel and followed his companions
into the willows.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>ONE OF THE LOST LEGION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the lost legion are two kinds of men. There are
those who have killed or buried so deep the divine fire
of their manhood that for them there seems no chance
of recovery in this world. There are those in whom
still burns somewhere a faint candle that may yet flame
to a dynamic glow of self-respect.</p>

<p>The young tramp slouching along the bank of Willow
Creek drank deep of the waters of despair. The
rancher had called him a slacker, rotten to the core. It
was a true bill. He was a man spoiled and ruined. He
had thrown away his life in handfuls. Down and dragging,
that’s what he was, with this damned vice a ball
and chain on his feet.</p>

<p>There was in him some strain of ignoble weakness.
There must be, he reasoned. Otherwise he would have
fought and conquered the cursed thing. Instead, he had
fought and lost. He could make excuses. Oh, plenty of
them. The pain—the horrible, intolerable pain! The
way the craving had fastened on him before he knew it
while he was still in the hospital! But that was piffling
twaddle, rank self-deception. A man had to fight, to
stand the gaff, to flog his evil yearnings back to kennel
like yelping dogs.</p>

<p>His declension had been swift. It was in his temperament
to go fast, to be heady. Once he let go of himself,
it had been a matter of months rather than of years.
Of late he had dulled the edge of his despair. The opiates
were doing their work. He had found it easier to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
live in the squalid present, to forget the pleasant past
and the purposeful future he had planned.</p>

<p>But now this girl, slim, clean, high-headed, with that
searing contempt for him in her clear eyes, had stirred
up again the devils of remorse. What business had he to
companion with these offscourings of the earth? Why
had he given up like a quitter the effort to beat back?</p>

<p>In the cold waters of the creek he washed his swollen
and bloodstained face. The cold water, fresh from the
mountain snows, was soothing to the hot bruised flesh
even though it made the wounds smart. He looked
down into the pool and saw reflected there the image of
himself. Beneath the eyes pouches were beginning to
form. Soon now he would be a typical dope fiend.</p>

<p>He was still weak from the manhandling that had
been given him. Into an inside coat pocket his fingers
groped. They brought out with them a small package
wrapped in cotton cloth. With trembling hands he
made his preparations, bared an arm, and plunged the
hypodermic needle into the flesh.</p>

<p>When he took the trail again after his companions,
Tug’s eyes were large and luminous. He walked with a
firmer step. New life seemed to be flowing into his
arteries.</p>

<p>Where the dusty road cut the creek he found the
other tramps waiting for him. Their heads had been
together in whispered talk. They drew apart as he
approached.</p>

<p>Taking note of Cig’s purple eye and bruised face, Tug
asked a question. “Was it the big foreman beat you
up?”</p>

<p>“You done said it, ’bo,” the crook answered out of the
side of his mouth.</p>

<p>“I reckon you got off easy at that,” Tug said bitterly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
“The boss bully didn’t do a thing to me but chew me
up and spit me out.”</p>

<p>“Wotcha gonna do about it?” Cig growled significantly.</p>

<p>The young fellow’s glance was as much a question as
his words. “What can I do but take it?” he asked sullenly.</p>

<p>Cig’s eyes narrowed venomously. He lifted his upper
lip in an ugly sneer. “Watch my smoke. No roughneck
can abuse me an’ get away with it. I’ll say he can’t.”</p>

<p>“Meaning?”</p>

<p>“I’m gonna fix him.”</p>

<p>Tug’s laughter barked. “Did you fix him when you
had a chance?” he asked ironically.</p>

<p>“Call that a chance? An’ the big stiff wide as a door.
’F I’d had a gun I’d ’a’ croaked him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if!”</p>

<p>“De bulls frisked me gun in Denver. But I’ll get me
a gat somewheres. An’ when I do—” The sentence
choked out in a snarl more threatening than words.</p>

<p>“Sounds reasonable,” Tug jeered.</p>

<p>“Listen, ’bo.” Cig laid a hand on the sleeve of the
young fellow’s coat. “Listen. Are youse game to take
a chance?”</p>

<p>Eyes filled with an expression of sullen distaste of Cig
looked at him from a bruised and livid face. “Maybe
I am. Maybe I ain’t. What’s on your mind?”</p>

<p>“I’m gonna get that bird. See?”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Stick around an’ gun him. Then hop a freight for
’Frisco.”</p>

<p>There was in the lopsided face a certain dreadful
eagerness that was appalling. Was this mere idle boasting?
Or would the gangster go as far as murder for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
revenge? Tug did not know. But his gorge rose at the
fellow’s assumption that he would join him as a partner
in crime.</p>

<p>“Kill him without giving him a chance?” he asked.</p>

<p>Again there was a sound like the growl of a wild
beast in the throat of the Bowery tough. “Wotcha givin’
me! A heluva chance them guys give us when they
jumped us. I’ll learn ’em to keep their hands off Cig.”
He added, with a crackle of oaths, “The big stiffs!”</p>

<p>“No!” exploded Tug with a surge of anger. “I’ll
have nothing to do with it—or with you. I’m through.
You go one way. I’ll go another. Right here I quit.”</p>

<p>The former convict’s eyes narrowed. “I getcha.
Streak of yellow a foot wide. No more nerve than a
rabbit. All right. Beat it. I can’t lose you none too
soon to suit me.”</p>

<p>The two glared at each other angrily.</p>

<p>York the peacemaker threw oil on the ruffled waters.
“’S all right, ’boes. No use gettin’ sore. Tug he goes
one way, we hit the grit another. Ev’rybody satisfied.”</p>

<p>Tug swung his roll of blankets across a shoulder and
turned away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>BETTY RIDES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Reed</span> had watched unhappily the young tramp
shuffle into the willows and disappear. She felt depressed
by a complex she could not analyze. In part it
was shame, for her father, for this tramp who looked as
though he were made for better things, for the whole
squalid episode; in part pity, not wholly divorced from
admiration at the boy’s insolence and courage. He
might be a wastrel, as her father had said. He might be
a ne’er-do-well. But by some sure instinct she knew
that there had been a time when he fronted with high
hope to the future. That momentary meeting of the
eyes had told her as much.</p>

<p>Something had killed him as surely as a bullet fired
through the heart. The boy he had been was dead.</p>

<p>Lon Forbes chuckled. “They’ll keep going, I reckon,
now they’ve found out this ain’t no Hotel de Gink.
You certainly handed that youngest bum his hat, Clint.
I’ll say you did.”</p>

<p>Now that it was over Reed was not very well satisfied
with his conduct. The hobo had brought the punishment
on himself. Still—there was something morally
degrading about such an affray. One can’t touch pitch
without paying the penalty.</p>

<p>“We’ll begin cutting this field to-morrow, Lon,” he
said shortly. “Hustle the boys up so’s to finish the
mesa to-day.” Across his shoulder he flung a question
at the girl. “You going to town, Bess?”</p>

<p>“In an hour or so. Want me to do something?” she
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Call at Farrell’s and see if he’s got in those bolts I
ordered.”</p>

<p>The ranchman strode to the car followed by Forbes.
The foreman was troubled by no doubts. His mind
functioned elementally. If hoboes camped on the
Diamond Bar K and made themselves a danger to the
crops, they had to be hustled on their way. When they
became insolent, it was necessary to treat them rough.
That was all there was to it.</p>

<p>Betty swung to the saddle and rode back to the house.
She was returning from an inspection of a bunch of
two-year-olds that were her own private property. She
was rather well off in her own right, as the ranch country
counts wealth. The death of her uncle a year before had
left her financially independent.</p>

<p>As Betty cantered into the open square in front of the
house, her father and the foreman were getting out of
the car. A chubby, flaxen-haired little lass came flying
down the porch steps a-quiver with excited delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy, Daddy, what d’you fink? I went out
to the barn an’—an’—an’ I fink Fifi’s got puppies,
’cause she—she—”</p>

<p>“Thought I told you to stay away from the barn,”
the ranchman chided.</p>

<p>His harsh voice dried up the springs of the child’s
enthusiasm. She drew back as though she had been
struck. From the winsome, wee face the eager, bubbling
delight vanished, the enchanting dimples fled. The
blue eyes became wells of woe. A small finger found
the corner of the Cupid’s-bow mouth.</p>

<p>Clint Reed, ashamed and angry at himself, turned
away abruptly. Little Ruth was the sunshine of his life,
the last pledge of his dead wife’s love, and he had deliberately
and cruelly wounded her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Swinging from the saddle, Betty ran to the porch.
Her arms enfolded the child and drew her tenderly close.
“Ruthie, tell big sister all about it,” she whispered
gently.</p>

<p>“D-d-d-daddy—” the sobbing little girl began, and
choked up.</p>

<p>“Daddy’s worried, dear. He didn’t mean to hurt
your precious little feelings. Tell Betty about Fifi’s puppies,
darling.”</p>

<p>Through her tears and between sobs Ruth told her
great news. Presently she forgot to weep and was led
to the scene of Fifi’s amazing and unique triumph. She
gave little squeals of delight when Betty handed her a
blind little creature to cuddle in spite of the indignant
mother’s protesting growls. The child held the warm
white-and-brown puppy close to her bosom and adored
it with her eyes. With reluctance she returned it at
last.</p>

<p>Ruth’s happiness was quite restored after her sister
had given her a glass of milk and a cookie and sent her
out to play.</p>

<p>The young woman waved her a smiling good-bye
and went to work.</p>

<p>She had some business letters to write and she went
to the room that served her as a library and office. The
sound of the typewriter keys drifted out of the open
window for an hour or more.</p>

<p>The girl worked swiftly. She had a direct mind that
found fluent expression through the finger-tips. When
she knew what she wanted to say, it was never any
trouble for Betty Reed to say it. A small pile of addressed
and sealed letters lay in the rack on the desk
before she covered the machine.</p>

<p>These she took with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Clint Reed she found tinkering with a reaper that
had gone temporarily out of service.</p>

<p>“Want anything more, Dad? I’m going now,” she
said.</p>

<p>“You’ve got that list I left on the desk. That’s all,
except the bolts.”</p>

<p>The sky was a vault of blue. Not even a thin, long-drawn
skein of cloud floated above. A hot sun baked
down on the dusty road over which Betty traveled.
Heat waves danced in front of her. There was no
faintest breath of breeze stirring.</p>

<p>The gold of autumn was creeping over the hills. Here
and there was a crimson splash of sumac or of maple
against the almost universal yellow toning. It seemed
that the whole landscape had drunk in the summer
sunshine and was giving it out now in a glow of warm
wealth.</p>

<p>The girl took a short cut over the hills. The trail led
by way of draw, gulch, and open slope to the valley in
which Wild Horse lay. She rode through the small business
street of the village to the post-office. Here she
bought supplies of the storekeeper, who was also post-master.</p>

<p>Battell was his name. He was an amiable and harmless
gossip. Wild Horse did not need a newspaper as
long as he was there to hand tobacco and local information
across the counter. An old maid in breeches,
Lon Forbes had once called him, and the description
serves well enough. He was a whole village sewing
circle in himself. At a hint of slander his small bright
eyes would twinkle and his shrunken little body seem
to wriggle like that of a pleased pup. Any news was
good news to him.</p>

<p>“Mo’ning, Miss Betty. Right hot, I’ll tell the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Ninety-nine in the shade this very minute. Bart Logan
was in to get Doc Caldwell for his boy Tom. He done
bust his laig fallin’ from the roof of the root house.
Well, Bart was sayin’ your paw needs help right bad
to harvest his wheat. Seems like if the gov’ment would
send out some of these here unemployed to work on
the ranches it would be a good idee. Sometimes Congress
acts like it ain’t got a lick o’ sense.”</p>

<p>Betty ordered coffee, sugar, tobacco, and other supplies.
While he waited upon her Battell made comment
pertinent and impertinent.</p>

<p>“That Mecca brand o’ coffee seems to be right popular.
Three pounds for a dollar. O’ course, if it’s for the
bunkhouse— Oh, want it sent out to the Quarter Circle
D E. How’re you makin’ it on your own ranch,
Miss Betty? Some one was sayin’ you would clean up
quite a bit from your beef herd this year, mebbe twelve
or fifteen thousand. I reckon it was Bart Logan.”</p>

<p>“Is Bart keeping my books for me?” the girl asked
dryly.</p>

<p>The storekeeper cackled. “Folks will gossip.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed. “How much is that corn meal a
hundred?”</p>

<p>“Cost you ten cents more’n the last. Folks talk about
cost of livin’ coming down. Well, mebbe ’tis an’
mebbe ’tain’t. I told Bart I wouldn’t believe you’d
cleared any twelve or fifteen thousand till I heard
you say so. That’s a lot of money, if any one asks
you.”</p>

<p>Apparently Betty misunderstood him. “Yes, you’re
high, but I’ll take two sacks. Send it to the Quarter
Circle and charge it to me.”</p>

<p>Betty stopped at the railroad station to ask the
agent about a shipment of goods her father was expecting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
and from there went to Farrell’s to find out about
the bolts.</p>

<p>It was well on toward noon when she took the road
for home. At Four-Mile Crossing it intersected the
railroad track. A man with a pack on his back was
plodding along the ties in the direction of Wild Horse.
The instant her eyes fell on him, the girl recognized the
tramp her father had beaten. The pallid face was covered
with wheals and bruises. Both of the sullen eyes
were ringed with purple and black.</p>

<p>They met face to face. Full into hers his dogged gaze
challenged. Without a word they passed.</p>

<p>Betty crossed the grade and followed a descent to a
small grove of pines close to the road. The sun was so
hot that she decided to dismount and give the pony a
breathing spell.</p>

<p>From the saddle she swung, then trailed the reins and
loosened the cinch.</p>

<p>A sound brought her head round sharply. Two men
had come over the brow of a little hill silently. One of
them was almost at her elbow. A twisted, malevolent
grin was on his lips. He was the hobo Lon Forbes had
thrashed two or three hours ago.</p>

<p>“Welcome to our city, goil,” he jeered in choice
Boweryese. “Honest to Gawd, you knock me dead.
Surest thing you know. We’ll treat you fine, not like
your dad an’ that other big stiff did us. We’ll not tell
youse to move on, m’ dearie. Nothin’ like that.”</p>

<p>The girl’s heart felt as though drenched in ice-cold
water. She had not brought with her the small revolver
she sometimes carried for rattlesnakes. Both instinct
and observation told her this man was vile and dangerous.
She was in his power and he would make her pay
for what her father had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>She trod down the fear that surged up in her bosom.
Not for nothing had she been all her life a daughter of
the sun and the wind and wide outdoor spaces.</p>

<p>“I stopped to rest my pony from the heat of the sun,”
she explained.</p>

<p>“You stopped to see old Cig,” he corrected. “An’
now you’re here it’ll be him an’ you for a while. The
hop-nut don’t belong to de same push as us no longer. I
shook him. An’ York don’t count. He’s no lady’s man,
York ain’t.”</p>

<p>The slim girl in the riding-suit could not quite keep
the panic out of her eyes. None of the motives that
swayed the men she knew would have weight with him.
He was both base and bold, and he had lived among
those who had small respect for a woman.</p>

<p>Betty’s glance moved to York. It found no comfort
there. The gross hobo was soft as putty. He did not
count, as his companion had openly sneered.</p>

<p>“No. I won’t stop,” she said, and made as though to
tighten the loosened cinch.</p>

<p>“Won’cha? Think again, miss. Old Cig ain’t seen a
skirt since he left li’l’ old New York. Sure as youse is a
foot high he’s hungry for a sweetie of his own.”</p>

<p>He put his hand on her arm. At the touch her self-control
vanished. She screamed.</p>

<p>The man’s fingers slid down to the wrist and tightened.
His other hand clamped over her mouth and cut off the
cry.</p>

<p>She writhed, twisting to free herself. In spite of her
slenderness she was strong. From her lips she tore his
hand and again called for help in an ecstasy of terror.</p>

<p>The crook of his arm garroted her throat and cut off
the air from her lungs. He bent her body back across
his hip. Still struggling, she strangled helplessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Youse would, eh?” His voice, his narrowed eyes,
exulted. “Forget it, miss. Cig’s an A1 tamer of Janes.
That’s de li’l’ old thing he’s de champeen of de world
at.”</p>

<p>He drew her closer to him.</p>

<p>There came a soft sound of feet thudding across the
grass. The arm about Betty’s throat relaxed. She heard
a startled oath, found herself flung aside. Her eyes
opened.</p>

<p>Instantly she knew why Cig had released her. The
man stood crouched, snarling, his eyes fixed on an approaching
runner, one who moved with the swift precision
of a half-back carrying a ball down a whitewashed
gridiron.</p>

<p>The runner was the tramp whose face her father had
battered to a pulp. He asked for no explanations and
made no comment. Straight for the released convict he
drove.</p>

<p>Cig had not a chance. The bad air and food of the
slums, late hours, dissipation, had robbed him of both
strength and endurance. He held up his fists and squared
off, for he was game enough. But Tug’s fist smashed
through the defense as though it had been built of paper.
The second-story man staggered back, presently went
down before a rain of blows against which he could find
no protection.</p>

<p>Tug dragged him to his feet, cuffed him hard with
his half-closed fist again and again, then flung him a
second time to the ground. He stood over the fellow,
his eyes blazing, his face colorless.</p>

<p>“Get up, you hound!” he ordered in a low voice
trembling with anger. “Get up and take it! I’ll teach
you to lay hands on a woman!”</p>

<p>Cig did not accept this invitation. He rolled away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
caught up York’s heavy tramping stick, and stood like a
wolf at bay, the lips lifted from his stained yellow teeth.</p>

<p>“Touch me again an’ I’ll knock your block off,” he
growled, interlarding the threat with oaths and foul
language.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” the girl begged of her champion. “Please
don’t. Let’s go. Right away.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the young fellow, white to the lips.</p>

<p>York flat-footed forward a step or two. “No use
havin’ no trouble. Cig he didn’t mean nothin’ but a bit
of fun, Tug. Old Cig wouldn’t do no lady any harm.”
The tramp’s voice had taken on the professional whine.</p>

<p>Tug fastened the girth, his fingers trembling so that
he could hardly slip the leather through to make the
cinch. Even in the reaction from fear Betty found time
to wonder at this. He was not afraid. He had turned his
back squarely on the furious gangster from the slums to
tighten the surcingle. Why should he be shaking like
a man in a chill?</p>

<p>The girl watched Cig while the saddle was being made
ready. The eyes in the twisted face of the convict were
venomous. If thoughts could have killed, Tug would
have been a dead man. She had been brought up in a
clean world, and she did not know people could hate in
such a soul-and-body blasting way. It chilled the blood
only to look at him.</p>

<p>The girl’s rescuer turned to help her into the saddle.
He gave her the lift as one does who is used to helping
a woman mount.</p>

<p>From the seat she stooped and said in a low voice,
“I want you to go with me.”</p>

<p>He nodded. Beside the horse he walked as far as
the road. “My pack’s back there on the track,” he said,
and stopped, waiting for her to ride away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Betty looked down at him, a troubled frown on her
face. “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>A bitter, sardonic smile twitched the muscles of the
bruised face. He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Looking for work?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Maybe I am,” he answered sullenly.</p>

<p>“We need men on the Diamond Bar K to help with
the harvest.”</p>

<p>“The ranch where I was kicked off?”</p>

<p>“Father’s quick-tempered, but he’s square. I’ll
talk with him about you—”</p>

<p>“Why waste your time?” he mocked mordantly.
“I’ll not impose on him a good-for-nothing loafer, a
worthless rotten-to-the-core hobo, a slacker, a wastrel
who ought to be on a rock-pile.”</p>

<p>“Dad didn’t mean all that. He was angry. But if
you don’t want to work for him, perhaps you’d work for
me. I own a ranch, too.”</p>

<p>He looked up the road into the dancing heat waves.
She was wasting pity on him, was she? No doubt she
would like to reform him. A dull resentment burned in
him. His sulky eyes looked into hers.</p>

<p>“No,” he said shortly.</p>

<p>“But if you’re looking for work,” she persisted.</p>

<p>“I’m particular about who I work for,” he told her
brutally.</p>

<p>She winced, but the soft dark eyes were still maternally
tender for him. He had fought for her, had saved
her from a situation that held at least degradation and
perhaps horrible despair. Moreover, young though he
was, she knew that life had mauled him fearfully.</p>

<p>“I need men. I thought perhaps—”</p>

<p>“You thought wrong.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry—about Father. You wouldn’t need to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
see him if you didn’t want to. The Quarter Circle D E
is four miles from the Diamond Bar K.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if it’s forty,” he said bluntly.</p>

<p>Her good intentions were at an <i>impasse</i>. The road was
blocked. But she could not find it in her heart to give
up yet, to let him turn himself adrift again upon a callous
world. He needed help—needed it desperately,
if she were any judge. It was written on his face that
he was sailing stormy seas and that his life barque was
drifting toward the rocks. What help she could give
she must press upon him.</p>

<p>“I’m asking you to be generous and forget what—what
we did to you,” she pleaded, leaning down impulsively
and putting a hand on his shoulder. “You saved
me from that awful creature. Isn’t it your turn now to
let me help you if I can?”</p>

<p>“You can’t help me.”</p>

<p>“But why not? You’re looking for work. I need men.
Wouldn’t it be reasonable for us to get together on
terms?” Her smile was very sweet and just a little
wistful, her voice vivid as the sudden song of a meadow-lark.</p>

<p>Under the warmth of her kindness his churlishness
melted.</p>

<p>“Good of you,” he said. “I’m much obliged. But
it’s no use. Your father had the right of it. I’m not
any good.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. Your life’s got twisted somehow.
But you can straighten it. Let me help. Won’t you?
Because of what you did for me just now.”</p>

<p>Her hand moved toward him in a tentative offer of
friendship. Automatically his eyes recorded that she
wore a diamond ring on the third finger. Some lucky
fellow, probably some clean young man who had given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
no hostages to vice, had won her sweet and gallant heart.</p>

<p>She was all eager desire and sympathy. For a moment,
as he looked into the dusky, mobile face that expressed
a fine and gallant personality, it seemed possible for him
to trample down the vice that was destroying him. But
he pushed this aside as idle sentiment. His way was
chosen for him and he could not go back.</p>

<p>He shook his head and turned away. The bitter, sardonic
smile again rested like a shadow of evil on his
good-looking face.</p>

<small>TUG IS “COLLECTED”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tug</span> followed the rails toward Wild Horse.</p>

<p>He groped in an abyss of humiliation and self-disgust.
Slacker! The cattleman’s scornful word had cut to the
quick. The taste of it was bitter. For he had not always
been one. In war days he had done his share.</p>

<p>How was it McCrae’s poem ran?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“We are the Dead. Short days ago</div>
<div class="verse">We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Yes, he had kept the faith in France, but he was not
keeping it now. The obligation was as binding on him in
peace as on the battle-field. He knew that. He recognized
it fully. But when the pain in his head began, his
mind always flew to the only relief he knew. The drug
had become a necessity to him. If the doctors had only
let him fight it out from the beginning without help, he
would not have become accustomed to the accursed
stuff.</p>

<p>But what was the use of going over that again and
again? He was done for. Why send his thoughts forever
over the same treadmill?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>The flaming sun poured down into the bowl of the
valley and baked its contents. He moved from the
track to the shade of a cottonwood and lay down. His
racing thoughts grew more vague, for the hot sun had
made him sleepy. Presently his eyes closed drowsily.
They flickered open and slowly shut a second time. He
began to breathe deeply and regularly.</p>

<p>The sun passed the zenith and began to slide down
toward the western hills. Still Tug slept.</p>

<p>He dreamed. The colonel was talking to him. “Over
the top, Hollister, at three o’clock. Ten minutes now.”
He shook himself out of sleep. It was time to get busy.</p>

<p>Slowly he came back blinking to a world of sunshine.
Two men stood over him, both armed.</p>

<p>“Must be one of ’em,” the shorter of the two said.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. See his outfit. All rags. We’ll collect
him an’ take him back to the ranch.”</p>

<p>They were cowboys or farmhands, Tug was not sure
which. He knew at once, however, that their intentions
were not friendly.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You,” the short, stocky one answered curtly. He
wore a big broad-rimmed hat that was both ancient and
dusty.</p>

<p>“Interesting. You a sheriff? Got a warrant for me?”</p>

<p>The little man raised the point of his thirty-eight
significantly. “Ain’t this warrant enough?”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble? What d’you want me for?”</p>

<p>“Tell him, Dusty,” the lank cowboy said.</p>

<p>“All right, Burt.” To the tramp he said roughly:
“We’ll learn you how to treat a lady. Get up. You’re
gonna trail back to the Diamond Bar K with us.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got the wrong man,” explained Tug.</p>

<p>“Sure. You’re jus’ travelin’ through the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
lookin’ for work,” Dusty jeered. “We’ve heard that
li’l’ spiel before. Why, you chump, the ol’ man’s autograph
is writ on yore face right now.”</p>

<p>Tug opened his mouth to expostulate, but changed his
mind. What was the use? He had no evidence. They
would not let him go.</p>

<p>“I guess you hold the aces.” He rose, stiffly, remarking
to the world at large, “I’ve read about those three-gallon
hats with a half-pint of brains in them.”</p>

<p>Dusty bridled. “Don’t get gay with me, young feller.
I’ll not stand for it.”</p>

<p>“No?” murmured the hobo, and he somehow contrived
to make of the monosyllable a taunt.</p>

<p>“Just for that I’ll drag you back with a rope.”</p>

<p>Dusty handed his weapon to the other cowboy,
stepped to his horse, and brought back a rope. He uncoiled
it and dropped the noose over the tramp’s head,
tightening it around his waist.</p>

<p>The riders swung to their saddles.</p>

<p>“Get a move on you,” Dusty ordered, giving the rope
a tug. The other end of it he had fastened to the horn
of the saddle.</p>

<p>Tug walked ahead of the horses through the sand. It
was a long hot tramp, and Dusty took pains to make it
as unpleasant as possible. If the prisoner lagged, he
dragged him on the ground, gibing at him, and asking
him whether he would insult another woman next time
he got a chance.</p>

<p>The cowpuncher found small satisfaction in the behavior
of the man at the other end of the rope. The
ragged tramp neither answered his sneers nor begged for
mercy. He took what was coming to him silently, teeth
clamped tight.</p>

<p>At last Burt interfered. “That’ll be about enough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Dusty. The old man’s gonna settle with him. It’s his
say-so about what he wants done to this guy.” He
added, a moment later: “I ain’t so darned sure we’ve
got the right one, anyhow. This bird don’t look to me
like a feller who would do a girl a meanness.”</p>

<p>“Hmp! You always was soft in the head, Burt,” his
companion grunted.</p>

<p>But he left his prisoner in peace after that. Burt had
said one true word. Clint Reed would not want a half-dead
hobo dragged to the Diamond Bar K. He would
prefer one that he could punish himself.</p>

<p>Tug plodded through the fine white dust that lay
inches deep on the road. A cloud of it moved with them,
for the horses kicked it up at every step until they ascended
from the valley into the hills. The man who
walked did not have the reserve of strength that had
been his before he had gone to the hospital. There had
been a time when he could go all day and ask for more,
but he could not do it now. He stumbled as he dragged
his feet along the trail.</p>

<p>They reached the summit of the pass and looked down
on the Diamond Bar K. Its fenced domain was a patchwork
of green and gold with a background of pineclad
ridges. The green patches were fields of alfalfa, the gold
squares were grain ripe for the mower.</p>

<p>Downhill the going was easier. But by the time the
horsemen and their prisoner drew up to the ranch house,
Tug was pretty well exhausted.</p>

<p>While Dusty went in to get Reed, the tramp sat on
the floor of the porch and leaned against a pillar, his
eyes closed. He had a ridiculous feeling that if he let go
of himself he would faint.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>“NOTHING BUT A GAY-CAT ANYHOW”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> an unusual depression Betty had watched the
tramp move down the dusty road to the railroad track
after he had declined her offer of employment. An energetic
young person, she was accustomed to having her
own way. One of her earliest delightful discoveries had
been that she could nearly always get what she wanted
by being eager for it and assuming that, of course, the
others involved would recognize her plan as best, or at
least would give up theirs cheerfully when she urged
hers.</p>

<p>But this ragged scamp, out of whose heart youth and
hope had been trampled, was leaving her dashed and rebuffed.
She liked to make conquests of people in bending
them to the schemes she made for the regulation of
her small universe, though she would have denied even
to herself that she liked to manage her friends. In the
case of this drear-eyed boy, the hurt was not only to her
vanity. He might be five or six years older than she, but
the mothering instinct—the desire to save him from
himself and his fate—fluttered yearningly toward
him.</p>

<p>She did not blame him. There was at least a remnant
of self-respect in his decision. Nobody wants to be done
good to. Perhaps she had seemed smug to him, though
she had not meant to be.</p>

<p>He was on her mind all the way back to the ranch, so
much so that she blurted out the whole story to her
father as soon as she saw him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Clint Reed moved to prompt action. He did not see
eye to eye with his daughter. What concerned him was
that these bums should waylay and insult Betty. It
was a nice state of affairs when a girl was not safe alone
on the roads. He gathered his men and gave them orders
to find the hoboes and bring them to the ranch.</p>

<p>The girl’s protest was lost on Reed. It hardly reached
his mind at all. Besides, this had become public business.
It was not her personal affair. If hoboes needed
to be taught a sense of decency, the men of the community
would attend to that.</p>

<p>Betty went into the house dissatisfied with herself.
She had not meant to make more trouble, but to enlist
her father’s sympathy in the cause of the young fellow
who had saved her from the other tramp. As for the
one who had attacked her, she did not care whether he
was punished or not. She had much rather no hue and
cry over the country was made about it. Though she
did not say so, she hoped the vagrants would get away
uncaught.</p>

<p>She busied herself with household duties. Under
her direction and with her help, Bridget the cook was
putting up half a dozen boxes of peaches. The two
women worked into the middle of the hot afternoon
before they had finished.</p>

<p>“An’ that’s that,” Bridget said with a sigh of relief as
she sealed the last jar. “Fegs, I don’t mind a hotter day
this summer. It’s a b’iler.”</p>

<p>She was an old family servant and was in part responsible
for the bringing up of Betty. More than one
rancher in the neighborhood had attempted the adventure
of wooing Bridget Maloney, but none of them had
been able to lure her from the Diamond Bar K to become
the mistress of a home of her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“You’d better lie down and sleep an hour, dear,” the
girl advised.</p>

<p>“An’ phwat would I be doin’ that for wid all these
kettles an’ pots to be cleaned up? Scat! Get ye out
o’ my kitchen now, mavourneen, an’ I’ll redd up in a
jiff.”</p>

<p>Betty found a magazine and walked out to the shade
of a pine grove where a hammock hung. She settled
herself comfortably and began to read. It was delightfully
cool among the pines after the hot kitchen. She
grew drowsy. Her eyes closed.</p>

<p>The sound of far-away voices was in her ears when
she wakened. As her thoughts cleared, so did the voices.
She heard Dusty’s, strident, triumphant.</p>

<p>“It’s up to the old man now.”</p>

<p>The girl turned in the hammock and saw the squat
cowpuncher go jingling into the house. Burt lounged
on a horse, his right leg thrown round the horn of the
saddle. Some one else, partly hidden from her by the
ponies, was sitting on the porch.</p>

<p>She got up quickly and walked toward the house. The
man on the porch, she saw presently, had a rope around
his waist the other end of which was fastened to the
saddle of Dusty’s mount. An eyeflash later she recognized
him.</p>

<p>“You!” she cried.</p>

<p>The tramp called Tug rose. He did not lift his hat, for
he no longer had one. But his bow and sardonic smile
gave an effect of ironic politeness.</p>

<p>“The bad penny back again,” he said.</p>

<p>“What have they been doing to you?” she asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>He had been a disreputable enough specimen when
she had last seen him. The swollen and discolored face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
the gaping shoes, the ragged coat; all of these he had
carried then. But there were scratches like skin burns
down one side of the jaw and on his hands that had come
since. His coat was in shreds. From head to foot dust
covered every available inch.</p>

<p>“Your men have been having a little sport. Why not?
The boss had his first and they had to follow his example.
They’re good obedient boys,” he scoffed bitterly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? What did they do?” she demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and she turned imperiously
to the man on horseback. “Burt, you tell me.”</p>

<p>The lank cowboy showed embarrassment. “Why,
Dusty he—he kinda dragged him when the fellow
lagged. Jus’ for a ways.”</p>

<p>“On the ground? That what you mean?” The dark
eyes flashed anger.</p>

<p>“Well, you might say so. He sorta stumbled, an’ he’d
been right sassy to Dusty, so—” Burt’s explanation
died away. He felt he was not getting very far
with it.</p>

<p>“So you acted like brutes to him—to a man who had
just fought for me when—when—” A sob of chagrin
and vexation choked up in her throat. She stamped her
foot in exasperation.</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited about me,” the victim gibed.
“I’m nothing but a gay-cat anyhow. What’s it matter?”</p>

<p>Dusty strutted out of the house, his spurs making
music.</p>

<p>The girl turned on him with pantherish swiftness.</p>

<p>“Who told you to torture this man, Dusty? What
right have you got to make yourself law on the Diamond
Bar? You’re only a drunken lunkhead, aren’t you?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Or did Father ask you to be judge and jury on the
ranch?”</p>

<p>It was ludicrous to see the complacency vanish from
the fatuous face. The jaw fell and the mouth opened.</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Betty, I figured as how he’d done you a
meanness, an’ I thought—”</p>

<p>She cut his explanation short with stinging ruthlessness.
“What for? You weren’t hired to think, but to
obey orders. You’d better get back into the wheatfield
before Father comes. Pronto.”</p>

<p>The cowboy shut his mouth with a view to opening it
again in self-defense, but Betty would have none of his
excuses. She shooed him from the scene indignantly.
While she was busy with Dusty, the lank rider quietly
vanished.</p>

<p>The prisoner watched her, the rope still about his
waist. His mind paid tribute to the energy with which
she got results.</p>

<p>“Greatly obliged,” he said with sarcasm. “I suppose
your father won’t have me hanged now.”</p>

<p>“Take off that rope,” she said.</p>

<p>“That’s an order, is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you for hating us all,” she flamed. “I
would in your place. The whole place is bewitched to-day,
I believe. We’re all acting like bullies instead of
the quiet, decent people we are. Take Dusty now. He’s
a good little fellow, but he thought you’d attacked me.
He wouldn’t stand that. Men in the ranch country
won’t, you know. They look after us women.”</p>

<p>“That’s a peculiarity of the ranch country, I suppose.”</p>

<p>She ignored the derisive gleam in his eyes. “No ...
no! Good men always do. I wish I could tell you—could
show you—my thanks because you stood up for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
me. I’ll never forget. It was fine, the way you fought
for me.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to that. I’d been saving a punch or two
for him. Don’t forget that I’m a good-for-nothing
bum, on the authority of your own father. No need of
getting sentimental. Don’t make the mistake of putting
me in a class with him and other such truly good men as
your friend Dusty and the lamblike foreman who
beat up Cig because he wouldn’t apologize for being
alive.”</p>

<p>Voice and manner both fleered at her, but she was
determined to accept no rebuff.</p>

<p>“Did Dusty hurt you? Can I do anything for you?
Tell me. I’d be so glad to. Let me get you a drink.”</p>

<p>Like a flash, she was off at her own suggestion to the
kitchen. His impulse was to go at once, but he could not
escape his past and be deliberately discourteous to a
woman whose only desire was to help him. He waited,
sullenly, for her return. Why could she not let him
alone? All he asked of the Diamond Bar K was for it to
let him get away and forget it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When the girl came back, it was with a pitcher and a
glass. The outside of the jug was beaded with moisture.
From within came the pleasant tinkle of ice.</p>

<p>Betty filled the tumbler with lemonade.</p>

<p>The vagabond had no desire to accept the hospitality
of the ranch, but he found it impossible to affront her
churlishly again.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, and drank.</p>

<p>The drink was refreshing. Two fresh-beaten eggs had
been stirred into it for nutrition.</p>

<p>“Another?” she begged, and poured without waiting
for an answer.</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile crept into his eyes. It was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
first hint of wholesome humor she had yet seen in him.
He offered her, with a little bow, a quotation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘I can no other answer make, but thanks,</div>
<div class="verse">And thanks, and ever thanks.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The dimples broke into her cheeks as her smile flashed
out in the pleasure of having broken the crust of his reserve.</p>

<p>“That’s Shakespeare, isn’t it? I’m dreadfully illiterate,
but it sounds like him.”</p>

<p>“It does a little, doesn’t it?” He raised the glass before
drinking. “Happy days, Miss Reed.”</p>

<p>“That goes double,” she said quickly.</p>

<p>The sardonic mask, that had for a moment been
lifted, dropped again over his face. “Many more like
this one,” he fleered.</p>

<p>“You may look back on it and find it a good day yet,”
she said bravely.</p>

<p>He handed back the empty tumbler. “Afraid I’m
not an optimist. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll be going.
The ranch might change its mind about that hanging
bee.”</p>

<p>“But I do mind,” she protested. “I don’t want you
to go yet. Please stay and meet my father. He’s not
really hard and cruel as you think.”</p>

<p>Again she saw on his lips the dry, bitter smile.</p>

<p>“Think I’ll take your word for it. I’ve met him
once.”</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t met him—not to know him,” she
cried softly, giving rein to swift impulse. “You’ve not
met my Daddy—the best man in Paradise Valley. You
can ask any one about him. He’s the squarest that ever
was. The man you met was exasperated and—and
not himself. Dad’s not like that—really.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Indeed!” His voice was a compound of incredulity
and indifference. It put her out of court.</p>

<p>But her good impulses were not easily daunted. She
had already learned that this young fellow wore armor
of chain-mail to protect his sensitive pride. In her horoscope
it had been written that she must give herself,
and still give and give. The color beat through her
dusky cheeks beneath the ardent eyes. She stabbed
straight at his jaundiced soul.</p>

<p>“If it were my father only that you don’t like—but
it isn’t—you don’t find joy in anything. Your mind’s
poisoned. I was reading the other day how Mr. Roosevelt
used to quote from Borrow’s ‘Lavengro’: ‘Life is
sweet, brother—there’s day and night, brother; both
sweet things; sun, moon, and stars, all sweet things—and
likewise there’s a wind on the heath.’ It’s because
he felt this in everything he did that they called him
‘Greatheart.’”</p>

<p>It came to him that the name might not inaptly be
applied to her. He thought of Browning’s “My Last
Duchess”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent12">“... She had</div>
<div class="verse">A heart—how shall I say?—too soon made glad,</div>
<div class="verse">Too easily impressed: she liked whate’er</div>
<div class="verse">She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He hardened his heart to her generous appeal to him.
“It’s a very comfortable point of view to have,” he said
with no spring of life in his voice.</p>

<p>“And a true one,” she added swiftly.</p>

<p>“If you say so, of course.” His skeptical smile made
no concessions.</p>

<p>He turned to leave, but stopped to look at a cloud of
white dust moving down the road toward them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>TUG SAYS, “NO, THANK YOU”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> advancing dust cloud rose from a little group of
horses and men. Some of the latter were riding. Others
were afoot.</p>

<p>“Lon’s caught them,” said Betty. “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Not so sorry as they’ll be,” returned the ragged
youth grimly.</p>

<p>The foreman swung heavily from his horse. Though
he was all muscle and bone, he did not carry his two
hundred pounds gracefully.</p>

<p>“We got the birds all right, Miss Betty, even if they
were hittin’ the trail right lively,” he called to the girl,
an ominous grin on his leathery face. “I guess they’d
figured out this wasn’t no healthy climate for them.”
He added, with a swift reversion to business, “Where’s
yore paw?”</p>

<p>“Not back yet. What’ll he do with them, Lon?” the
girl asked, her voice low and troubled.</p>

<p>Distressed in soul, she was looking for comfort. The
big foreman gave her none.</p>

<p>“He’ll do a plenty. You don’t need to worry about
that. We aim to keep this country safe for our womenfolks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish he wouldn’t. I wish he’d let them go,”
she said, almost in a wail.</p>

<p>“He won’t. Clint ain’t that soft.” Forbes stared
at the disreputable vagrant standing beside Betty.
“What’s he doing here?”</p>

<p>“Dusty dragged him back. That’s all the sense he
has.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Lon spoke just as though the vagrant were not present.
“Lucky for him he’s got an alibi this time.”</p>

<p>“Is it necessary to insult him after he protected me?”
the girl demanded, eyes flashing. “I’m ashamed of
you, Lon.”</p>

<p>He was taken aback. “I reckon it takes more’n that
to insult a hobo.”</p>

<p>“Is a man a hobo because he’s looking for work?”</p>

<p>The foreman’s hard gaze took in the man, his white
face and soft hands. “What would he do if he found it?”
he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>“You’ve no right to say that,” she flung back. “I
think it’s hateful the way you’re all acting. I tell you
he fought for me—after what Father did to him.”</p>

<p>“Fought for you?” This was news to Lon. His
assumption had been that the young fellow had merely
entered a formal protest in order to clear himself in case
retribution followed. “You mean with his fists?”</p>

<p>“Yes—against the thin-faced one. He thrashed him
and put me on my horse and started me home. Then
Dusty ropes him and drags him here on the ground and
you come and insult him. He must think we’re a grateful
lot.”</p>

<p>As they looked at the slim, vital girl confronting him
with such passionate and feminine ferocity, the eyes of
the foreman softened. All her life she had been a part of
his. He had held her on his knee, a crowing baby, while
her dimpled fingers clung to his rough coat or explored
his unshaven face. He had fished her out of an irrigation
ditch when she was three. He had driven her to
school when for the first time she started on that great
adventure. It had been under his direction that she had
learned to ride, to fish, to shoot. He loved her as though
she had been flesh of his flesh and blood of his blood. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
was a delight to him to be bullied by her and to serve
her whims.</p>

<p>“I renig,” he said. “Clint never told me the boy done
that. I had it doped out he was just savin’ his own hide.
But I’ll take it all back if it’s like you say. Shake, son.”</p>

<p>The tramp did not refuse to grip the big brown hand
thrust at him. Nor did he accept the proffered alliance.
By a fraction of a second he forestalled the foreman by
stooping to knot a broken lace in one of the gaping
shoes.</p>

<p>Cig, who had been edging closer, gave Tug a rancorous
look. “I ain’t forgettin’ this,” he promised. “I’ll
get youse good some day for rappin’ on me.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t tell on you. Some of my men brought
him here in the gather like we did you,” Forbes explained.</p>

<p>“Wot’ell youse givin’ me? He rapped. That’s wot
he done, the big stiff. An’ I’ll soitainly get him right
for it.”</p>

<p>“That kind of talk ain’t helpin’ you any,” the foreman
said. “If you got any sense, you’ll shut yore trap
an’ take what’s comin’.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it. Don’t youse worry about that. You’d
better kill me while youse are on the job, for I’ll get you,
too, sure as I’m a mont’ old.”</p>

<p>Reed drove up in the old car he used for a runabout.
He killed the engine, stepped down, and came up to the
group by the porch.</p>

<p>“See you rounded ’em up, Lon.”</p>

<p>“Yep. Found ’em in the cottonwoods acrost the
track at Wild Horse.”</p>

<p>The ranchman’s dominant eyes found Tug. “Howcome
you here?” he asked.</p>

<p>The gay-cat looked at him in sullen, resentful silence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
The man’s manner stirred up in the tramp a flare of
opposition.</p>

<p>“Dusty brought him here. I want to tell you about
that, Dad,” the girl said.</p>

<p>“Later.” He turned to Tug. “I want a talk with
you—got a proposition to make you. See you later.”</p>

<p>“Not if I see you first,” the ragged nomad replied
insolently. “I never did like bullies.”</p>

<p>The ranchman flushed angrily, but he put a curb on
his temper. He could not afford to indulge it since he
was so much in this youth’s debt. Abruptly he turned
away.</p>

<p>“Bring the other two to the barn,” he ordered Forbes.
“We’ll have a settlement there.”</p>

<p>York shuffled forward, in a torment of fear. “See
here, mister. I ain’t got a thing to do with this.
Honest to Gawd, I ain’t. Ask Tug. Ask the young lady.
I got respeck for women, I have. You wouldn’t do dirt
to an old ’bo wot never done you no harm, would you,
boss?”</p>

<p>His voice was a whine. The big gross man was on the
verge of blubbering. He seemed ready to fall on his
knees.</p>

<p>“It’s true, Dad. He didn’t touch me,” Betty said
in a low voice to her father.</p>

<p>“Stood by, didn’t he? Never lifted a hand for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p>“You go into the house. Leave him to me,” ordered
Reed. “Keep this young man here till I come back.”</p>

<p>Betty knew when words were useless with her father.
She turned away and walked to the porch.</p>

<p>The cowpunchers with their prisoners moved toward
the barn. York, ululating woe, had to be dragged.</p>

<p>Left alone with the tramp called Tug, Betty turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to him a face of dread. “Let’s go into the house,” she
said drearily.</p>

<p>“You’d better go in. I’m taking the road now,” he
said in answer.</p>

<p>“But Father wants to see you. If you’ll wait just a
little—”</p>

<p>“I have no business with him. I don’t care to see
him, now or any time.” His voice was cold and hard.
“Thank you for the lemonade, Miss Reed. I’ll say
good-bye.”</p>

<p>He did not offer his hand, but as he turned away he
bowed.</p>

<p>There was nothing more for Betty to say except
“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>In a small voice of distress she murmured it.</p>

<p>Her eyes followed him as far as the road. A sound
from the barn drove her into the house, to her room,
where she could cover her ears with the palms of her
small brown hands.</p>

<p>She did not want to hear any echo of what was taking
place there.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>A RIFT IN THE LUTE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the cool of the evening Justin Merrick drove down
from the Sweetwater Dam to the Diamond Bar K ranch.
It was characteristic of him that his runabout was up
to date and in perfect condition. He had an expensive
taste in the accessories of life, and he either got the best
or did without.</p>

<p>Hands and face were tanned from exposure to the
burning sun of the Rockies, but he was smooth-shaven
and immaculate in the engineer’s suit which fitted his
strong, heavy-set figure so snugly.</p>

<p>He drove with precision, as he did everything else in
his well-ordered life. There was in his strength no quality
of impatience or turbulence. He knew what he
wanted and how to get it. That was why he had traveled
so far on the road to success and would go a great
way farther.</p>

<p>To-night he anticipated two pleasant hours with
Betty Reed. He would tell her about the work and how
it was getting along, his difficulties with the sand formation
at the head gates and how he was surmounting
them. Even before she spoke, he would know from her
eager eyes that she was giving him the admiration due
a successful man from his sweetheart.</p>

<p>Afterward he would pass to more direct and personal
love-making, which she would evade if possible or accept
shyly and reluctantly. She was wearing his ring, but he
doubted whether he had really stormed the inner fortress
of her heart. This uncertainty, and the assurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
that went with it of a precious gift not for the first
chance comer, appealed to his fastidious instinct, all the
more that he was sure she would some day come to him
with shining eyes and outstretched hands.</p>

<p>To-night Merrick found Betty distrait and troubled.
Her attention to the recital of his problems was perfunctory.
He was conscious of a slight annoyance. In
spite of his force, Justin was a vain man, always ready
to talk of himself and his achievements in a modest way
to an interested and interesting young woman.</p>

<p>It appeared that her father had had a difficulty with
some tramps, which had eventuated in insolence that
had brought upon the vagrants summary physical punishment.
From her account of it, Justin judged that
Reed had not handled the matter very wisely. There
was a way to do such things with a minimum of friction.</p>

<p>But he saw no need of worrying about it. The tramps
had been given what they deserved and the affair was
closed. It was like a woman to hold it heavily on her
conscience because one of the ne’er-do-wells chanced to
be young and good-looking.</p>

<p>“If you’d seen him,” Betty protested. “A gentleman
by the look of him, or had been once, fine-grained, high-spirited,
and yet so down-and-out.”</p>

<p>“If he’s down-and-out, it’s his own fault. A man’s
never that so long as he holds to self-respect.”</p>

<p>This was incontrovertibly true, but Betty chose to
be irritated. Justin was so obviously successful. He
might have had a little sympathy for the underdog, she
thought. Everybody did not have a square, salient jaw
like his. Weakness was not necessarily a crime.</p>

<p>“He looks as though life had mauled him,” she said.
“It’s taken something vital out of him. He doesn’t
care what happens any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“If he can only mooch his three meals a day and
enough cash to keep him supplied with bootleg poison,”
the engineer added.</p>

<p>They were walking up to the Three Pines, a rocky
bluff from which they could in the daytime see far down
the valley. She stopped abruptly. If she did not stamp
her foot, at least the girl’s manner gave eloquently the
effect of this indulgence.</p>

<p>“He’s not like that at all—not at all. Don’t you ever
sympathize with any one that’s in hard luck?” she
cried out, her cheeks glowing with a suffusion of underlying
crimson.</p>

<p>“Not when he lies down under it.”</p>

<p>She flashed at him a look resentful of his complacency.
It held, too, for the first time a critical doubt. There
was plenty to like about Justin Merrick, and perhaps
there was more to admire. He got things done because
he was so virile, so dominant. To look at the lines and
movements of his sturdy body, at the close-lipped
mouth and resolute eyes, was to know him a leader of
men. But now a treasonable thought had wirelessed
itself into her brain. Had he a mind that never ranged
out of well-defined pastures, that was quite content
with the social and economic arrangement of the world?
Did there move in it only a tight little set of orthodox
ideas?</p>

<p>“How do you know he lies down under it?” she asked
with spirit. “How do we know what he has to contend
with? Or how he struggles against it?”</p>

<p>If his open smile was not an apology, it refused, anyhow,
to be at variance with her. “Maybe so. As you
say, I didn’t see him and you did. We’ll let it go at
that and hope he’s all you think he is.”</p>

<p>Betty, a little ashamed of her vagrant thoughts, tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to find a common ground upon which they could stand.
“Don’t you think that men are often the victims of
circumstance—that they get caught in currents that
kinda sweep them away?”</p>

<p>“‘I am the captain of my soul,’” he quoted sententiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>you</i> are,” she admitted, after one swift glance
that took in the dogged, flinty quality of him. “But
most of us aren’t. Take Dad. He’s strong, and he’s
four-square. But he wouldn’t have gone as far as he did
with these tramps if he hadn’t got carried away. Well,
don’t you think maybe this boy is a victim of ‘the
bludgeonings of chance’? He looked like it to me.”</p>

<p>“We make ourselves,” he insisted. “If the things we
buck up against break us, it’s because we’re weak.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—” Betty’s protest died away. She was
not convinced, and she made another start. “It seems
to me that when I read the new novelists—Wells,
Galsworthy, or Bennett, say—one of the things I get
out of them is that we <i>are</i> modified by our environment,
not only changed by it, but sometimes made the prey of
it and destroyed by it.”</p>

<p>“Depends on how solid on our feet we are,” answered
the engineer. “That’s the plea of the agitator, I know.
He’s always wanting to do impossible things by law
or by a social upheaval. There’s nothing to it. A man
succeeds if he’s strong. He fails if he’s weak.”</p>

<p>This creed of the individualist was sometimes Betty’s
own, but to-night she was not ready to accept it. “That
would be all very well if we all started equal. But we
don’t. What about a man who develops tuberculosis,
say, just when he is getting going? He’s weak, but it’s
no fault of his.”</p>

<p>“It may or may not be. Anyhow, it’s his misfortune.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
You can’t make the world over because he’s come a
cropper. Take this young tramp of yours. I’d like to
try him out and show you whether there’s anything to
him. I’d put him on the work and let him find his level.
Chances are he’d drift back to the road inside of a week.
When a man’s down-and-out, it isn’t because he doesn’t
get a chance, but because of some weakness in himself.”</p>

<p>Betty knew that in the case of many this was true.
For a year or more she had been an employer of labor
herself. One of the things that had impressed her among
the young fellows who worked for her was that they did
find their level. The unskilled, shiftless, and less reliable
were dropped when work became slack. The intelligent
and energetic won promotion for themselves.</p>

<p>But she did not believe that it was by any means a
universal truth. Men were not machines, after all.
They were human beings. However, she dropped the
subject.</p>

<p>“He’s gone, so you won’t have a chance to prove your
case,” she said. “Tell me about the work. How is it
going?”</p>

<p>The Sweetwater Dam project had been initiated to
water what was known as the Flat Tops, a mesa that
stretched from the edge of the valley to the foothills.
It had been and still was being bitterly opposed by
some of the cattlemen of Paradise Valley because its
purpose was to reclaim for farming a large territory over
which cattle had hitherto ranged at will. Their contention
held nothing of novelty. It had been argued all over
the West ever since the first nesters came in to dispute
with the cattle barons the possession of the grazing
lands. A hundred districts in a dozen States had heard
the claim that this was a cattle country, unfit for farming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and intensive settlement. Many of them had seen it
disproved.</p>

<p>The opposition of powerful ranching interests had not
deterred Justin Merrick. Threats did not disturb him.
He set his square jaw and pushed forward to the accomplishment
of his purpose. As he rode or drove through
the valley, he knew that he was watched with hostile
eyes by reckless cowpunchers who knew that his success
would put a period to the occupation they followed.
Two of them had tried to pick a quarrel with him at
Wild Horse on one occasion, and had weakened before
his cool and impassive fearlessness.</p>

<p>But he did not deceive himself. At any hour the
anger of these men might flare out against him in explosive
action. For the first time in his life he was
carrying a revolver.</p>

<p>Clint Reed was a stockholder and a backer of the irrigation
project. He owned several thousand acres on
the Flat Tops, and it was largely on account of his
energy that capital had undertaken the reclamation
of the dry mesa.</p>

<p>The head and front of the opposition was Jake
Prowers, who had brought down from early days an
unsavory reputation that rumor said he more than deserved.
Strange stories were whispered about this mild-mannered
little man with the falsetto voice and the skim-milk
eyes. One of them was that he had murdered
from ambush the successful wooer of the girl he wanted,
that the whole countryside accepted the circumstantial
evidence as true, and in spite of this he had married
the young widow within a year and buried her
inside of two. Nesters in the hills near his ranch had
disappeared and never been seen again. Word passed
as on the breath of the winds that Prowers had dry-gulched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> 
them. Old-timers still lived who had seen him
fight a duel with two desperadoes on the main street of
Wild Horse. He had been carried to the nearest house
on a shutter with three bullets in him, but the two bad
men had been buried next day.</p>

<p>The two most important ranchmen in the valley were
Clint Reed and Jake Prowers. They never had been
friendly. Usually they were opposed to each other on
any public question that arose. Each was the leader of
his faction. On politics they differed. Clint was a Republican,
Jake a Democrat. There had been times when
they had come close to open hostilities. The rivalry between
them had deepened to hatred on the part of
Prowers. When Reed announced through the local
paper the inception of the Sweetwater Dam project,
his enemy had sworn that it should never go through
while he was alive.</p>

<p>Hitherto Prowers had made no move, but everybody
in the district knew that he was biding his time. Competent
engineers of the Government had passed adversely
on this irrigation project. They had decided
water could not be brought down from the hills to the
Flat Tops. Jake had seen the surveys and believed
them to be correct. He was willing that Reed and the
capitalists he had interested should waste their money
on a fool’s dream. If Justin Merrick was right—if he
could bring water through Elk Creek Cañon to the Flat
Tops—it would be time enough for Prowers to strike.
Knowing the man as he did, Clint Reed had no doubt
that, if it became necessary in order to defeat the project,
his enemy would move ruthlessly and without
scruple. It was by his advice that Justin Merrick kept
the dam guarded at night and carried a revolver with
him when he drove over or tramped across the hills.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>UNDER FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> day the faint far whir of the reaper could have
been heard from the house of the Diamond Bar K
ranch. The last of the fields had been cut. Much of the
grain had been gathered and was ready for the thresher.</p>

<p>The crop was good. Prices would be fair. Clint Reed
rode over the fields with the sense of satisfaction it always
gave him to see gathered the fruits of the earth.
His pleasure in harvesting or in rounding-up beef steers
was not only that of the seller looking to his profit.
Back of this was the spiritual gratification of having
been a factor in supplying the world’s needs. To look
at rippling wheat ripening under the sun, to feed the
thresher while the fan scattered a cloud of chaff and the
grain dropped into the sacks waiting for it, ministered
to his mental well-being by justifying his existence. He
had converted hundreds of acres of desert into fertile
farm land. All his life he had been a producer of essentials
for mankind. He found in this, as many farmers
do, a source of content. He was paying his way in the
world.</p>

<p>To-day Reed found the need of vindication. He was
fonder of Betty than he was of anything or anybody else
in the world, and he knew that he was at the bar of her
judgment. She did not approve of what he had done.
This would not have troubled him greatly if he had been
sure that he approved of it himself. But like many willful
men he sometimes had his bad quarter of an hour
afterward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>It was easy enough to make excuses. The Diamond
Bar K had been troubled a good deal by vagrants on
the transcontinental route. They had robbed the smokehouse
only a few weeks before. A gang of them had
raided the watermelon patch, cut open dozens of green
melons, and departed with such ripe ones as they could
find. Naturally he had been provoked against the whole
breed of them.</p>

<p>But he had been too hasty in dealing with the young
scamp he had thrashed. Clint writhed under an intolerable
sense of debt. The boy had fought him as long as
he could stand and take it. He had gone away still
defiant, and had rescued Betty from a dangerous situation.
Dragged back at a rope’s end to the ranch by the
luckless Dusty, he had scornfully departed before Reed
had a chance to straighten out with him this added indignity.
The owner of the Diamond Bar K felt frustrated,
as though the vagabond had had the best of
him.</p>

<p>He was not even sure that the severe punishment he
had meted out to the other tramps had been wise. The
man Cig had endured the ordeal unbroken in spirit. His
last words before he crept away had been a threat of
reprisal. The fellow was dangerous. Clint read it in his
eyes. He had given orders to Betty not to leave the
ranch for the next day or two without an escort. Yet he
still felt uneasy, as though the end of the matter had not
come.</p>

<p>It was now thirty hours since he had last seen the
hoboes. No doubt they were hundreds of miles away by
this time and with every click of the car wheels getting
farther from the ranch.</p>

<p>He rode back to the stable, unsaddled, and walked to
the house. Betty was in the living-room at the piano.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
She finished the piece, swung round on the stool, and
smiled at him.</p>

<p>“Everything fine and dandy, Dad?”</p>

<p>His face cleared. It was her way of telling him that
she was ready to forgive and be forgiven.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Then, abruptly, “Reckon I get off wrong foot
first sometimes, honey.”</p>

<p>He was in a big armchair. She went over to him, sat
down on his knees, and kissed him. “’S all right, Dad,”
she nodded with an effect of boyish brusqueness. Betty,
too, had a mental postscript and expressed it. “It’s
that boy. Nothing to do about it, of course. He
wouldn’t let me do a thing for him, but—Oh, well, I
just can’t get him off my mind. Kinda silly of me.”</p>

<p>“Not silly at all,” demurred Clint. “Feel that way
myself—only more so.” He cleared his throat for a
confession. “Fact is, Bess, he’s managed to put me in a
hole. Or else I’ve put myself there. It’s that infernal
quick temper of mine. I’d no business to let myself go.
Of course, I was figurin’ him just a bum like the others,
an’ for that matter he is a tramp—”</p>

<p>“He quoted Shakespeare at me,” inserted Betty, by
way of comment.</p>

<p>“I dare say. He’s no ignorant fool. I didn’t mean
that. What was it he called me?” The ranchman
smiled ruefully. “A local God Almighty on tin wheels!
Maybe I do act like one.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” agreed Betty.</p>

<p>The smile that went with the word robbed her concurrence
of its sting. It was tender and understanding,
expressed the world-old superiority of her sex over the
blundering male who had always claimed mastership.
There were times when Betty was a mother to her
father, times when Clint marveled at the wisdom that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
had found lodgment in the soft young body of this vivid
creature who was heritor of his life and yet seemed so
strangely and wonderfully alien to it.</p>

<p>“Point is that I didn’t measure up to my chance and
he did,” Reed went on gloomily. “It don’t set well with
me, honey. After I’d thrashed him till he couldn’t
stand, he goes right away an’ fights for you because
you’re a woman. Makes me look pretty small, I’ll say.
I’d like to take him by the hand and tell him so. But he
wouldn’t have it that way. I’ve got to play my cards
the way he’s dealt ’em. Can’t say I blame him, either.”</p>

<p>“No, he had a right to refuse to have anything more
to do with us after the way we’d treated him.”</p>

<p>“Mostly we get second chances in this life, but we
don’t always, Bess. Oh, well, no use crying over spilt
milk. What’s done’s done.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed. “Don’t worry, Dad. I did my
best to get him to stay—went down on my knees almost.
But he wouldn’t. There’s something queer
about him. What is it? He acts as though he doesn’t
care what becomes of him, as though he’s let go somehow.
Did you notice that?”</p>

<p>“Going to the devil fast as he can, looked like to me.”</p>

<p>This was probably accurate enough as a summary,
but it did not explain why to Betty. She dismissed the
subject for the moment, because Ruth came into the
room followed by Bridget.</p>

<p>The child was in her nightgown and had come to kiss
them before going to bed. She ran to her father, threw
her arms around his neck, and gave him a great bear
hug. Long since she had forgotten his harshness of the
morning.</p>

<p>But he had neither forgotten nor forgiven himself. In
the first place, he had been unjust. The injunction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
against going to the barn had not been a blanket one.
It had applied only to that part of the building where
the blooded stallion was kept in a box stall. He had
hurt her feelings as a vent to his annoyance at what
had taken place by the creek a half-hour earlier. It
was pretty small business, he admitted, to take out his
self-disgust on an innocent four-year-old.</p>

<p>He held Ruth close in his arms while Bridget waited
smilingly and the little one confided to him plans about
the puppies.</p>

<p>“’N’ I’m gonna have Lon make me a wagon, ’n’ I’ll
drive it jus’ like Betty does the team, ’n’ I fink I’ll call
the puppies Prince ’n’ Rover ’n’ Baby Fifi ’n’—’n’
everyfing,” she concluded all in a breath.</p>

<p>“That’ll be bully,” the father agreed, stroking the
soft flaxen curls fondly. He wondered reproachfully
why it was that he could turn on those he loved, as he
had done on the child this morning. He had never done
it before with Ruth, and he resolved he never would
again.</p>

<p>Ruth kissed Betty good-night and went out of the
room in the arms of Bridget, held close to her ample
bosom, kicking and squealing with delight because she
was being tickled in the ribs.</p>

<p>As soon as Betty was in her own room, alone with her
thoughts and the rest of the world shut out, her mind
went back to the problem of the boy who had so early
made such shipwreck of his life. She puzzled over this
while she was preparing for bed and afterward while she
lay between the white sheets, barred squares from the
window frames checkering the moonlight on the linen.
What in the world could cause a man, educated, clean-fibered,
strong, to let go of life like that?</p>

<p>It could not be a woman. In spite of her youth, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
knew this by instinct. A game man did not give up
because of blows dealt to him from the outside. The
surrender had to come from within. No wounds at the
hands of another can subdue the indomitable soul.
Young though she was, she knew that. Books of fiction
might say the contrary, but she had a sure conviction
they were wrong. What was it Browning said?—“...Incentives
come from the soul’s self.” Well, the
converse of it must also be true.</p>

<p>Somewhere in this boy—she persisted in thinking of
him as a boy, perhaps because his great need so filled
her with the desire to help him—there must be a weak
strain. It was not, could not be, a vile one. She held to
that steadily and surely, without any of the passionate
insistence that doubt engenders. Ragged and dusty
though he was physically, on the drift to destruction,
cynically self-condemned, he was yet essentially clean
and fine, a strain of the thoroughbred in him. That was
her judgment, and she was prepared to wager all she
had on the truth of it.</p>

<p>Betty did not sleep. Thoughts drifted through her
mind as fleecy clouds do across a summer sky. The
magnet of them was this youth who had already drunk
so deeply of life’s bitterness. He extraordinarily stimulated
her interest.</p>

<p>It must have been near midnight that she heard quick
voices and lifted her head to the cry of “Fire!” Sketchily
she dressed and ran downstairs. The blaze was in
the lower meadow where the wheat was gathered for
the thresher. A great flame leaped skyward and filled
the night with its reflection.</p>

<p>One of the men from the bunkhouse was running toward
the unpent furnace. She caught up a saddle blanket
from the porch and followed. In the lurid murk figures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
like marionettes moved to and fro. As she ran, she
saw that there were three fires, not only one. This surprised
her, for the distance between two of them was at
least one hundred and fifty yards. It was strange that
in this windless night a spark had traveled so far.</p>

<p>The roar of the conflagration reminded her of some
huge living monster in a fury. Tongues of flame shot
heavenward in vain menace to the stars.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” Forbes shouted at her. “All we can
do is see it don’t spread.” He was flailing at a line of
fire beginning to run in the dry stubble.</p>

<p>“How did it start?” she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Fire-bugs.”</p>

<p>“You mean—on purpose?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“The tramps?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t sayin’ who.” He shouted to make his voice
heard above the crackle of the bellowing red demon that
had been set loose. Already he spoke hoarsely from a
throat roughened by smoke.</p>

<p>“Where’s Dad?” she called back.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. Ain’t seen him since I left the house.”
Dusty gave information. “Saw him runnin’ toward
the creek awhile ago.”</p>

<p>Almost instantly Betty knew why. He, too, must
have guessed that this fire had come from no chance
spark, but of set design. No doubt he was trying to head
off the incendiary.</p>

<p>“Just which way?” she asked the cowpuncher.</p>

<p>Dusty jerked a thumb to the left. The girl turned and
moved swiftly in the direction of the fringe of bushes
that rose as a vague line out of the darkness. She believed
her father’s instinct was true. Whoever had fired
the stacks would retreat to the willows and make his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
escape along the creek bed, hiding in the bushes if the
pursuit grew close.</p>

<p>Before she had taken a dozen steps a sound leaped
into the night. It was a revolver shot. Fear choked her.
She began to run, her heart throbbing like that of a
half-grown wild rabbit in the hand. Faint futile little
cries broke from her throat. A sure intuition told her
what she would find by the creek.</p>

<p>Her father lay on a sand spit close to the willows. He
was dragging himself toward the cover of some brush.
From the heavy foliage a shot rang out.</p>

<p>Betty flew across the open to her father.</p>

<p>“Look out!” he called sharply to her. “He’s in the
willows. Down here.” Reed caught at her arm and
pulled her behind him where he lay crouched.</p>

<p>The automatic of the man in ambush barked again.
A spatter of sand stung Betty’s face. Almost simultaneously
came the bull roar of the foreman’s hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“You’re shot, Daddy,” the girl whimpered.</p>

<p>“Keep still!” he ordered.</p>

<p>A heavy body crashed through the bushes in flight.
At the same time came the thump of running feet.
Dusty broke into sight, followed by the foreman.</p>

<p>The wounded rancher took command. “He went
that way, boys,” he said, and pointed down the creek.
“Lit out a minute ago. Hustle back to the house and
get guns, then cut down the road in the car and head
him off.”</p>

<p>Forbes nodded to Dusty. “You do that. Take the
boys with you. Hit the creek at the ford and work up.”
He turned to his employer. “How about it, Clint?
Where’d he hit you? How bad?”</p>

<p>“In the leg. It’ll wait. You get him, Lon.”</p>

<p>The foreman pushed into the willows and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>Reed called him back, but he paid no attention. The
ranchman fumed. “What’s the matter with the dawg-goned
old idiot? No sense a-tall. That’s no way to do.
He’ll get shot first thing he knows.”</p>

<p>Her father was so much his usual self that Betty’s
terror fell away from her. If he were wounded fatally, he
would not act like this.</p>

<p>He had been hit just above the top of his laced boots.
Betty uncovered the wound and bathed it with water
she brought from the creek in Clint’s hat. Around the
wound she bound a large handkerchief she found in his
hip pocket.</p>

<p>“Does it hurt much?” she asked, her soft voice
mothering him.</p>

<p>“Some. Know I’ve got a leg. Lucky for me you came
along. It must ’a’ scared him off. You an’ Lon too.”</p>

<p>“See who he was?”</p>

<p>“Too dark.”</p>

<p>“Think it was the tramps? Or Jake Prowers?”</p>

<p>“The tramps. Not the way Jake pulls off a job. He’s
no bungler.”</p>

<p>She sat down and put his head in her lap. “Anything
else I can do, Dad? Want a drink?” she asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>Reed caught her little hand and pressed it. “Sho!
Don’t you go to worryin’ about me, sweetheart. Doc
Rayburn, he’ll fix me up good as new. When Lon
comes back I’ll have him—”</p>

<p>He stopped. A rough voice was speaking. A foot
struck a stone. Vague figures emerged from the gloom,
took on distinctness. The big one was Lon Forbes. He
walked behind a man who was his prisoner, his great
hands clamped to the fellow’s arms.</p>

<p>Betty stood up and waited, her eyes fastened on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
them as they moved forward. Her heart was going like
a triphammer. She knew what she dreaded, and presently
that her apprehensions were justified.</p>

<p>The foreman’s prisoner was the tramp who called
himself Tug.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>“ONE SQUARE GUY”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Betty’s cheeks the delicate wild-rose bloom had
fled. Icy fingers seemed to clutch at her heart and
squeeze the blood from it. This was the worst that
could happen, since she knew her father was not
wounded to death.</p>

<p>Lon spoke, grimly. “Bumped into him down the
creek a ways—hidin’ in the willows. Heard a rustling
an’ drapped in on him onexpected. Thought he
wouldn’t come with me at first, then he changed his
mind an’ thought he would.”</p>

<p>The tramp said nothing. His dogged eyes passed
from Betty to her father. She thought there leaped into
them a little flicker of surprise when they fell upon the
ranchman sitting on the ground with his leg bound up.</p>

<p>“Have you taken his gun from him?” Reed asked.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t find it. He must ’a’ throwed it away.”
The foreman passed an exploring hand over the body of
the prisoner to make sure that he had not missed a concealed
weapon. “No, sir. He ain’t got a gat with him
now, unless he’s et it.”</p>

<p>“Take him to the bunkhouse and keep him guarded.
We’ll ’phone for the sheriff. Soon as you get to the
house call up Doc Rayburn and have him run right out.
Then hook up a team and come get me,” the ranch-owner
directed.</p>

<p>From the fog of Betty’s distress a small voice projected
itself. “You’re not going to send for the sheriff
without making sure, Dad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Sure of what?” The steel-gray eyes were hard and
cold.</p>

<p>“Sure he did it. He hasn’t said so.”</p>

<p>Reed’s laughter was harsh and without humor. “Nor
he ain’t liable to. Right now he’s trying to fix up his
alibi.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to hear what he’s got to say?”</p>

<p>“He can tell it in court.”</p>

<p>Betty turned from him to the prisoner. “Why don’t
you say something?”</p>

<p>She did not get past the defense of his sardonic smile.
“What shall I say?”</p>

<p>“Tell him you didn’t do it,” she begged, seeking
assurance for herself.</p>

<p>“Would he believe me? Would you?”</p>

<p>There came to her a conviction that she would—if he
said it in a way to inspire confidence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>The veil of irrision lifted from his eyes. He looked
straight at her. “I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>Instantly Betty knew he was telling the truth. A
warm resurgent wave flooded her veins. His life was
bound up with tragedy. It had failed of all it had set out
to be. But she knew, beyond doubt or evidence, that he
had not fired the stacks or shot her father. The amazing
thing now, to her mind, was that even for a moment she
could have believed he would kill at advantage in cold
blood.</p>

<p>“I knew it! I knew it all the time!” she cried.</p>

<p>“How did you know all that?” her father asked.</p>

<p>“Because.”</p>

<p>It was no answer, yet it was as good as any she could
give. How could she phrase a feeling that rested only on
faith in such a way as to give it weight to others?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“I’m one o’ these Missouri guys,” the foreman
snorted. “He’ll have to show me. What’s he doin’
here? What was he hidin’ out in the bushes for? How
could he tell soon as I jumped him that a man had been
shot?”</p>

<p>“He can explain that,” she urged; and to the vagrant,
“Can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I can,” he answered her.</p>

<p>“We’re waiting,” snapped Reed, and voice and manner
showed that he had prejudged the case.</p>

<p>The young man met his look with one of cold hostility.</p>

<p>“You can keep on waiting—till the sheriff comes.”</p>

<p>“Suits me,” snapped the ranchman. “Hustle along,
Lon. No use wasting time.”</p>

<p>The foreman and his prisoner departed. Betty stayed
with her father, miserably conscious that she had failed
to avert the clash of inimical temperaments. None the
less she was determined to keep the young man out of
the hands of the law.</p>

<p>She began at once to lay siege to her father.</p>

<p>“I knew he didn’t do it. I knew he couldn’t. It was
that one they call Cig. I know it was.”</p>

<p>“All three of ’em in it likely.”</p>

<p>“No. They had quarreled. He wouldn’t be in it with
them. That Cig thought he had told you about his attacking
me. He threatened this Tug. I think he’d have
shot him just as he did you—if he’d got a chance.”</p>

<p>“If he did shoot me. That’s not been proved.”</p>

<p>“Well, if this one—the one they call Tug—if he
did it, why didn’t he have a gun when Lon found him?
Lon says he came on him unexpectedly. He had no
time to get rid of it. Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he dropped it while he was running.”</p>

<p>“You know you don’t believe that, Dad,” she scoffed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
“He’d have stopped to pick it up. Don’t you see he had
to have that gun—the man that shot you did—to
make sure of getting away? And when Lon found him
he would have killed Lon, too. He’d have had to do it—to
save himself from the hangman. The fact that
this Tug didn’t have a gun proves that he didn’t shoot
you.”</p>

<p>“Say he didn’t, then. Does it prove he wasn’t in cahoots
with the man who did? What was he hiding here
on the ground for?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t give him a chance to tell. He was ready
to, if you’d let him.”</p>

<p>“I asked him, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad, you know how you asked him,” she reproached.
“He’s got his pride, same as we have. If he
wasn’t in this—and I know he wasn’t—you can’t
blame him for getting stubborn when he’s badgered.
His explanations would have tumbled out fast enough if
he’d been guilty.”</p>

<p>This struck Reed as psychologically true. The fellow
had not acted like a guilty man. He had held his head
high, with a scornful and almost indifferent pride.</p>

<p>“What did I say, for him to get his back up so
quick?” the ranchman grumbled.</p>

<p>“It’s the way you said it, and the way Lon acted.
He’s quick-tempered, and of course he’s fed up with our
treatment of him. Wouldn’t you be?”</p>

<p>“What right has he to travel with a bunch of crooks
if he doesn’t expect to be classed as one?”</p>

<p>“Well, he hasn’t.” Betty put her arms round his
neck with a warm rush of feeling. Motives are usually
mixed in the most simple of us. Perhaps in the back of
her mind there was an intuition that the road to her
desire lay through affection and not argument. “I can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
row with you now, Daddikins, when you’re wounded
and hurt. I’m so worried about you. I thought—a
while ago—when I saw you lying on the ground and
that murderer shooting at you—”</p>

<p>She stopped, to steady a voice grown tremulous in
spite of herself. He stroked her black hair softly.</p>

<p>“I know, li’l’ girl. But it’s all right now. Just a clean
flesh wound. Don’t you feel bad,” he comforted.</p>

<p>“And then that boy. I don’t want us to rush into
doing anything that will hurt the poor fellow more.
We’ve done enough to him. We’d feel awf’ly bad if we
got him into trouble and he wasn’t the right man.”</p>

<p>Reed surrendered, largely because her argument was
just, but partly, too, because of her distress. “Have it
your own way, Bess. I know you’re going to, anyhow.
We’ll hear his story. If it sounds reasonable, why—”</p>

<p>Her arms tightened in a quick hug and her soft cheek
pressed against his rough one. “That’s all I want, Dad.
I know Clint Reed. He’s what Dusty calls one square
guy. If you listen to this tramp’s story, he’ll get justice,
and that’s all I ask for him.” She dismissed the subject,
sure in her young, instinctive wisdom that she had said
enough and that more would be too much. “Is the leg
throbbing, Daddy? Shall I run down to the creek and
get water to bathe it? Maybe that would help the
pain.”</p>

<p>“No, you stay right here where it’s dark and quit
talking. The boys may drive that fellow back up the
creek. My leg’ll be all right till Rayburn sees it.”</p>

<p>“You think he’ll come back here again?” she asked,
her voice a-tremble.</p>

<p>“Not if he can help it, you can bet on that. But if the
boys hem him in, and he can’t break through, why, he’ll
have to back-track.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>The girl’s heart began to flutter again. She had plenty
of native courage, but to lie in the darkness of the night
in fear of an assassin shook her nerves. What would he
do if he came back, hard-pressed by the men, and found
her father lying wounded and defenseless? In imagination
she saw again the horrible menace of his twisted
face, the lifted lip so feral, the wolfish, hungry eyes.</p>

<p>Would Lon Forbes never come back? What was he doing?
What was keeping him so long? He had had time
long since to have reached the house and hitched a team.
Maybe he was wasting precious minutes at the telephone
trying to get the sheriff.</p>

<p>A dry twig crackled in the willows and Betty’s hand
clutched spasmodically at her father’s arm. She felt
rather than saw his body grow taut. There came a
sound of something gliding through the saplings.</p>

<p>Betty scarce dared breathe.</p>

<p>A patter of light feet was heard. Clint laughed.</p>

<p>“A rabbit. Didn’t think it could be any one in the
willows. We’d ’a’ heard him coming.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” whispered Betty.</p>

<p>The rumble of wagon wheels going over disintegrated
quartz drifted to them.</p>

<p>“Lon’s coming,” her father said.</p>

<p>Presently they heard his voice talking to the horses.
“Get over there, Buckskin, you got plenty o’ room.
What’s eatin’ you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Forbes stopped on the bluff and came down. “Left
the fellow with Burwell tied up in the bunkhouse. Got
both the sheriff and Doc Rayburn. How’s the leg,
Clint?”</p>

<p>Reed grunted a “’S all right,” and showed the foreman
how to support him up the incline to the wagon.</p>

<p>Five minutes later they were moving back toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
ranch house. The fired stacks had burned themselves
out, but smoke still rolled skyward.</p>

<p>“Keller’s watchin’ to see everything’s all right there,”
Forbes said. “I don’t aim to take chances till we get
the whole crop threshed.”</p>

<p>“Might ’a’ been worse,” Clint said. “If that fellow’d
known how to go at it, he could have sent half the crop
up in smoke. We’re lucky, I’ll say.”</p>

<p>“Luckier than he is. I’ll bet he gets ten years,” the
foreman said with unction.</p>

<p>Neither father nor daughter made any answer to that
prophecy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>MR. NE’ER-DO-WELL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tug</span> walked to the bunkhouse beside the foreman, the
latter’s fingers fastened like steel bands to his wrist. If
Forbes said anything to his prisoner during the tramp
through the wheatfield, the young fellow scarcely heard
it. His mind was full of the girl who had defended him.
In imagination she still stood before him, slim, straight,
so vitally alive, her dark eyes begging him to deny the
charge that had been made against him.</p>

<p>The low voice rang in his brain. He could hear the
throb in it when she had cried, “Tell him you didn’t
do it,” and the joyous lift of her confident “I knew it—I
knew it all the time.”</p>

<p>The vagrant’s life was insolvent in all those assets of
friendship that had once enriched it. He had deliberately
bankrupted himself of them when he had buried
his identity in that of the hobo Tug, driven to it by the
shame of his swift declension. It had been many months
since any woman had clung so obstinately to a belief
in him regardless of facts. He had no immediate family,
no mother or sister with an unshakable faith that went
to the heart of life.</p>

<p>But this girl who had crossed his path—this girl
with the wild-rose color, the sweetness that flashed so
vividly in her smile, the dear wonder of youth in every
glance and gesture—believed in him and continued
to believe in spite of his churlish rejection of her friendliness.</p>

<p>Though he was one of the lost legion, it was an evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
of the divine flame still flickering in him that
his soul went out to meet the girl’s brave generosity.
In his bosom was a warm glow. For the hour at least
he was strong. It seemed possible to slough the weakness
that rode him like an Old Man of the Sea.</p>

<p>His free hand groped its way to an inner pocket and
drew out a package wrapped in cotton cloth. A fling of
his arm sent it into the stubble.</p>

<p>“What you doin’?” demanded Forbes.</p>

<p>“Throwing away my gun and ammunition,” the
tramp answered, his sardonic mouth twitching.</p>

<p>“It don’t buy you anything to pull that funny stuff,”
growled the foreman. “You ain’t got a gun to throw
away.”</p>

<p>Forbes turned the captured vagrant over to Burwell,
one of the extra harvest hands, and left him at the bunkhouse
while he went to telephone the doctor and the
sheriff.</p>

<p>It was a busy night at the Diamond Bar K. The foreman
drove away and presently returned. Tug heard
the voices of Betty and her father as they moved toward
the house. Some one chugged up to the house in a
car with one spark plug fouled or broken.</p>

<p>Burwell went to the door of the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>“Get ’em, Dusty?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” the cowpuncher answered while he was
loosening the plug. “But, y’betcha, we’ll get ’em if this
bird we done got caged didn’t play a lone hand.”</p>

<p>Presently Dusty drove away again, in a hurry to rejoin
his companions. He had come back to find out
whether anything new had been discovered.</p>

<p>The foreman showed up in the doorway. “The boss
wants to have a talk with you, young fellow,” he said.</p>

<p>Betty would have known without any explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
that the prisoner had no intention of running away.
But Lon had no perception of this. He did not release
his grip until the tramp was in the living-room.</p>

<p>The owner of the Diamond Bar K lay on a lounge and
Betty was hovering close to him as nurses do in their
ministrations.</p>

<p>Reed spoke at once. “Let’s get down to brass tacks,
young man. Put your cards on the table if you’re in
the clear. Come through clean. What do you know
about this business?” The rancher’s voice was crisp,
but not unfriendly.</p>

<p>Tug sensed at once a change in attitude toward him.
He had come expecting to be put through the third
degree. It was possible that was being held in reserve
for him. His mind moved cautiously to meet Reed.</p>

<p>“What do you mean come clean—confess?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Call it what you want to. You claim you didn’t
shoot me—that you weren’t in to-night’s job at all.
Let’s hear your alibi.”</p>

<p>“If you’d care to tell it to us,” Betty suggested
gently.</p>

<p>The vagrant looked at her. “Why not? I don’t fire
wheatfields and I don’t shoot from ambush.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s have it,” the wounded man said
impatiently.</p>

<p>“When I left the ranch yesterday, I went to Wild
Horse and camped a mile or so out of town. I didn’t
care to meet the fellows I’d been with. They blamed me
for having them hauled back to the ranch here—thought
I’d hurried back to squeal on them. But I was
looking for work and I wasn’t going to run away from
them. About noon I tramped it into town to see about
getting a job. I saw this Cig in a store. He was buying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
a gun and ammunition for it. He didn’t see me, so I
passed by. Later I went back to the store and made
sure, by asking the clerk, that Cig had bought the gun.”</p>

<p>Betty broke in eagerly. “And you thought he meant
to kill Father. So you followed him out here to-night,”
she cried.</p>

<p>“Not quite,” the tramp answered with an edge of
cold anger in his voice. “I wouldn’t have lifted a
finger for your father. He brought it on himself. He
could look out for himself. I don’t know what he did
to Cig yesterday afternoon, but I know it was plenty.
What would he expect from a fellow like Cig after he’d
treated him that way? He’s dangerous as a trapped
wolf and just about as responsible morally.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Say I brought this fellow and his gun on
me by giving him what was coming to him. What next?”
asked Reed brusquely.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get him out of my head. If I could have
been sure he’d limit his revenge to you and your foreman— But
that was just it. I couldn’t. He might lie
in wait for your daughter, or he might kidnap her little
sister if he got a chance.”</p>

<p>“Kidnap Ruthie?” the girl broke in, all the mother
in her instantly alert. “Oh, he wouldn’t do that, would
he?”</p>

<p>“Probably not.” He turned to her with the touch of
deference in voice and manner so wholly lacking when
he faced her father. “I thought of it because the other
day we were talking of the Charley Ross case, and Cig
had a good deal to say about just how a kidnapping
ought to be done. The point is that I wouldn’t trust
him, after what your people have done to him, any
more than I would a rattlesnake. His mind works that
way—fills up with horrible ideas of getting even. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
he’s absolutely unmoral, far as I’ve been able to find
out.”</p>

<p>“So you trailed him out here—on the off chance that
he might hurt Betty or Ruth. Is that it?” inquired the
rancher.</p>

<p>“You see I can’t mind my own business,” the prisoner
jeered. “You invited me forcibly to get off your land
and stay off, but I had to come trespassing again.”</p>

<p>“No need to rub it in,” blurted Reed by way of
apology. “I got off wrong foot first with you. Not all
my fault, though. You acted mighty foolish yourself.
Still, you’ve got a legitimate kick coming. I’ll admit
that. Sorry—if that does any good.”</p>

<p>He did not offer to shake hands. It was his judgment
that this youth with the somber eyes so ready to express
bitter self-mockery did not want to have anything more
to do with him.</p>

<p>The vagrant offered no comment. His white face did
not soften or its rigidity relax. Clearly he would make
no pact with the Diamond Bar K.</p>

<p>Betty asked a swift question, to bridge the silence
left by his rejection of her father’s tentative acknowledgment
of wrong. “How did you know when they were
coming?”</p>

<p>“I knew they’d come after dark, and probably to-night.”
He corrected himself at once. “I oughtn’t to
say ‘they,’ for I knew York wouldn’t come. He hasn’t
the nerve.”</p>

<p>“You’re dead right there,” the foreman said. “All
we give him was a first-class chapping, an’ he howled
like he was bein’ killed. That other guy, now, he’s one
sure-enough bad actor, if you ask me, but he’s game.”</p>

<p>“So I lay in the brush near their camp,” the gay-cat
explained. “York went down to the railroad yards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
He’s likely riding the rods for ’Frisco by this time.
After dark Cig started this way and I followed. When
he left the track, I trailed behind. The moon wasn’t
up, and I lost him. I knew he couldn’t be far away, so
I headed for the ranch, keeping close to the creek. For
a while I didn’t see or hear anything more of him. Just
as I’d made up my mind to strike for the house, the
fires flamed up. I heard two or three shots, then some
one went by me on the run. Time for me to be going, I
thought. Your Mr. Forbes was of another opinion. He
showed up just then and invited me to stay.”</p>

<p>Reed’s cool, shrewd eyes had not lifted from the
tramp while he was making the explanation. He was
convinced that he had been told the truth. The man
had come out to do a service for his children, which was
equivalent to one for Clint himself. Again he felt the
sting of self-reproach at having played a poor part in
this drama that had been flung into the calmness of
their quiet round of existence.</p>

<p>“Glad Lon did find you,” the wounded man responded.
“I’ll go the whole hog and tell you straight
I’m right sorry for the way I’ve treated you. That
makes twice you’ve come through for me. I’ll not forget
it, Mr.——” He hesitated, waiting for the other to
supply the name.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ne’er-do-well,” suggested the white-faced
tramp, and on his face was a grim, ironic smile.</p>

<p>Reed flushed. “You’ve a right to remind me of that
if you want to. It’s not the first time I’ve been a damned
fool, and it likely won’t be the last. But you can tie to
this, young man.” The steel-gray eyes seized those of
the hobo and held them fast. “If ever there comes a
time when you need Clint Reed, he’ll be here waiting.
Send for him, and he’ll come. That’s a promise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Will he bring along with him Dusty and Mr. Forbes
and the rest of his outfit?” Tug asked, a derisive flash
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Say anything you’ve a mind to. I’ll not blame you
if you hold hard feelings. I would in your place. But
don’t forget the fact. If you’re ever in trouble, Betty
and I are here waiting to be called on.”</p>

<p>The girl slipped her hand into her father’s and gave it
a quick squeeze. It told better than words how glad
she was of the thing he was doing.</p>

<p>“I can count on that knock-out punch of yours, can
I?” the prisoner asked ironically.</p>

<p>The girl came forward impulsively, a shell-pink flag
fluttering in her cheeks. “Please don’t feel that way.
We’re sorry—we truly are. We’d love to have you
give us a chance to show you how we feel.”</p>

<p>The hard lines on his face broke. An expression warm
and tender transformed it. He turned his back on the
others and spoke for her ears alone.</p>

<p>“An angel from heaven couldn’t do more for me
than you’ve done, Miss Reed. I’ll always remember it—always.
If it’s any comfort for you to know it, be sure
one scamp will never forget the girl who out of her
infinite kindness stretched down a hand to him when
he was sinking in the mud.”</p>

<p>“But won’t you take the hand?” she whispered, all
eager desire to help. “It’s not a very strong one, I’m
afraid, but it’s ever so willing.”</p>

<p>He took it, literally, and looked down at it where it
lay in his. “I’m taking it, you see. Don’t blame yourself
if it can’t pull the scalawag out of the mire. <i>Facilis
descensus Averni</i>, you know.”</p>

<p>“Is your trouble so far beyond help?” she murmured,
and in her eyes he read the leap of her sweet and gallant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
soul toward him. “I can’t believe it. Surely there can’t
be any sorrow or distress that friendship won’t lighten.
If you’ll let me in where you are—if you won’t shut
me out by freezing yourself up—”</p>

<p>The honk of an automobile horn had drawn Forbes
to the window, from which point of observation he was
reporting progress to his employer.</p>

<p>“Reckon it’s the sheriff an’ Doc Rayburn.... Yep.
They’re gettin’ outa the car an’ comin’ in.” He turned
to Reed. “What about this fellow here? What’s the
play we’re makin’ to Daniels?”</p>

<p>“That he came to warn us, but got here too late. I’ll
do the talking, Lon.”</p>

<p>A fat little man with a medicine case in his hand
bustled into the room. At his heels moved a big blond
cattleman whose faded blue eyes were set in a face of
brown leather.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble? What’s the trouble?” fumed
the doctor. It was his habit of mind and manner to
effervesce.</p>

<p>“Some tramps set fire to my wheat and shot me up,
Doc. Nothing worth putting in the papers, I reckon,”
answered the ranchman easily.</p>

<p>“Let’s see about that. Let’s see,” the doctor said
with his little touch of pomposity.</p>

<p>He stripped his automobile gloves for action.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>“IS THIS BIRD A PRISONER, OR AIN’T HE?”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Dr. Rayburn, with Betty and Forbes to wait
upon him, made preparations to dress the wound, Sheriff
Daniels listened to the story of the ranchman. The
officer was a hard-headed Westerner who applied common
sense to the business of maintaining law and order.</p>

<p>“Looks like that tramp Cig did it, unless this young
fellow is passing the buck for an alibi,” he said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Reed shook his head. “No, Frank. This boy’s all
right. I thought at first he might be in it, but I know now
he wasn’t. He helped my girl out of a hole yesterday—licked
this Cig because he got fresh with Bess. Even
before that he had parted company with the other two.
You’ll go to barkin’ up the wrong tree if you suspect
him.”</p>

<p>The sheriff looked at Tug. The vagrant was standing
beside the piano glancing at the music piled on top of it.
Ragged, dusty, and unshaven, he was not a prepossessing
youth. Livid and purple bruises ridged his pallid
cheeks. Daniels found in the face something not quite
normal, and, since he was a clean outdoor man himself,
an unhealthy variation from the usual stirred in him a
slight feeling of distrust.</p>

<p>“By yore way of it, Clint, you beat up this hobo here
for trespassing on yore land. I’d say from the looks of
him you gave him a plenty. Does it look reasonable
to you that he’d trail the other hobo for miles to protect
you from him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Not to protect me, Frank. He gave it to me straight
it wasn’t for me. ’Seems he got to worryin’ about
what this Cig might do to the children. The fellow
had been talkin’ about kidnapping and how easy it
could be pulled off. So this one—Tug he calls himself—followed
Cig here. Looks reasonable to me. He’s
game. You’d ought to have seen him come at me with
his legs wobbling under him. Well, a game man doesn’t
make war on women and kids, does he?”</p>

<p>“Our kind of man doesn’t. But he’s not our kind.
Looks to me like a dope fiend. Expect he’s got a lot of
these anarchist ideas tramps are carryin’ around the
country nowadays. I don’t say he’s guilty. What I do
say is that I’m not convinced he’s innocent. Far as
being game goes, this other man Cig is game enough,
too, by what you say. Stood the gaff, and then bawled
you out, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He’s game like a cornered wolf. I tell you this one’s
different. He’s an educated man gone wrong. At first
I didn’t get him right myself.”</p>

<p>“Sure you’ve got him right now?” the sheriff asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Far as this business goes, I have. I’ll admit he’s got
no cause to like me, but I’ve got a hunch he’s white.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have facts than hunches.”</p>

<p>The owner of the Diamond Bar K was a new convert
to the opinion he was giving voice to, and he was therefore
a more eager advocate of it. “Look at this from my
point of view, Frank. I thrash him till he can’t stand,
and he pays me back by lookin’ out for Bess when she’s
in trouble. One of my men hauls him back here at the
end of a rope. He settles that score by tramping five
or six miles to help us again. I’d be a poor sort if I
didn’t come through for him now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Well, I’ll not push on my reins, Clint,” the officer
promised. “Very likely you’re right, and I’m sure not
aimin’ to make trouble for any innocent man. This
tramp of yours will have every chance in the world to
show he’s straight. I’ll not arrest him unless I’ve
got the goods on him.”</p>

<p>Dr. Rayburn, ready for business, came forward
fussily. “You quit exciting my patient, Sheriff. Quit
it. And move on out of this sick-room. I don’t want
any one here but Miss Bessie and Bridget and Lon
Forbes.”</p>

<p>The sheriff laughed. “All right, Doc. It’s yore
say-so.”</p>

<p>He walked out of the room, the vagrant by his
side.</p>

<p>“Am I under arrest?” the latter asked.</p>

<p>“You’re not under arrest, but I’d like yore word
that you’ll stick around till I’ve had a chance to size this
thing up.”</p>

<p>“If I’d fire wheat and shoot a man down from cover,
what good would my word be?”</p>

<p>“That’s so.” The sheriff’s eyes swept up and down
him. “Still, I’ll ask for yore word. Reed believes in
you. I don’t reckon you did this job. Will you stay
where I can reach you for a few days? I might need you
as a witness.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The sheriff was surprised, not at the promise, but at
the sense of reliance he put in it. It came to him that,
if this young fellow gave his word, he would keep it at
any cost. Since this was scarcely reasonable, he tried to
reject the conviction. He recalled his court experience
in listening to witnesses. Some of the most convincing
were liars out of whole cloth, while honest ones with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
nothing to conceal were at times dragged sweating
through a tangle of incompatible statements.</p>

<p>“Better go to the bunkhouse and wait there. I’ll fix
it with Forbes so you can sleep there to-night,” Daniels
said.</p>

<p>Tug walked to the bunkhouse and sat down on the
porch. After a time the car returned with the men. They
had not been able to find any one hiding in the brush
or hurrying to escape.</p>

<p>Daniels took charge of the man-hunt. “We’ll tackle
this job on horseback, boys,” he said. “This fellow
will make for the railroad. He’ll jump a train at a station
or a water-tank if he can. We’ll patrol the points
where the cars stop.”</p>

<p>The foreman came down to the bunkhouse. Evidently
he had his orders. “Boys, the sheriff’s in charge
of this job now. You’ll do as he says.”</p>

<p>Dusty spoke up. He and others had been looking
with open and menacing suspicion at the paroled prisoner.
That young man sat on the porch, chair tipped
back on two legs, smoking a cigarette with obvious
indifference to their hostility. The coolness of his detachment
from the business of the hour was irritating.</p>

<p>“What about this bird here?” Dusty wanted to know.
“Is he a prisoner, or ain’t he?”</p>

<p>Forbes passed on further orders. He did it in a dry
voice that refused responsibility. “He ain’t. The boss
says he’s under obligations to him an’ you boys will
treat him right. An’ he means every word of it. I
wouldn’t advise none of you to get gay with—with
our guest.”</p>

<p>“How is the boss?” asked Burt.</p>

<p>“Doc says he’ll do fine if no complications occur.”</p>

<p>“He’s got the right idea, Doc has,” Burwell grinned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
“Always leave yoreself an alibi. Operation successful,
but patient shy of vitality. No flowers, please.”</p>

<p>“Tha’s no way to talk,” reproved Forbes. “The old
man’s all right. He’s lying there on the chaste lounge
chipper as a woodchuck in the garbage barrel at a dude
ranch. You got a consid’rable nerve to get funny about
him, Burwell.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t aim for to get funny about him, but about
the doc,” apologized the harvest hand. “Looks like
when I open my mouth I always put my foot in it.”</p>

<p>“You put more ham an’ aigs an’ flannel cakes in it
than any guy I ever did see,” commented the foreman.
“I been watchin’ to see if all that fuel wouldn’t mebbe
steam you up for work, but I ain’t noticed any results
yet. Prob’ly you wear out all yore strength talkin’ foolishness.”</p>

<p>“That had ought to hold you hitched for a while, Burwell,”
Dusty chuckled.</p>

<p>“All right, boys. Let’s go. Get busy,” the sheriff
ordered crisply.</p>

<p>They poured out of the bunkhouse to get their horses.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>A JOB</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> rose at daybreak and got Justin Merrick on the
telephone. After preliminary greetings she asked a question.</p>

<p>“Would it be convenient for you to come down this
morning? There’s something I want to talk over with
you if you have time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it convenient,” came the answer. “Anything
serious happened?”</p>

<p>“That tramp Cig came back last night to fire the
wheat. He shot Father. No, he’s not badly hurt,
but—”</p>

<p>“I’ll be right down.”</p>

<p>It was like Merrick that he did not wait for breakfast.
He was at the Diamond Bar K as soon as his car could
bring him.</p>

<p>Betty set out a breakfast for him in the dining-room
and waited on him herself with the aid of Ruth, who
trotted back and forth with honey, syrup, and butter for
his hot cakes. Miss Ruth was not exactly fond of Merrick.
He did not give himself out enough. But she appreciated
him. He had some good ideas about bringing
her candy, teddy bears, and dolls.</p>

<p>When Betty had reassured her fiancé about Mr. Reed
and answered such questions as he put about the fire
and the man-hunt, she came to the real reason for asking
him to call.</p>

<p>“It’s about that young man who was with the
tramps,” she explained. “You offered to give him work.
I wish you would, Justin. You’re so reliable. It might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
be a great thing for him to be under you—the very
thing he needs.”</p>

<p>Merrick was not especially pleased at being chosen as
the agent to reform a vagrant. He was a very busy
man. Also, he had a theory that every man must stand
on his own feet. But he had made a promise. He did
not make many, but he always kept those he made.</p>

<p>“Let’s get this right, Beth,” he answered, smiling. “I
said I’d put him to work and see what he had in him.
I’m willing to do that. It’ll be up to him to make good.
No special favors or sympathy or anything of that
sort.”</p>

<p>Betty met his smile. “I don’t think you’d find it very
easy to waste any sympathy on this young man. He’s
not that kind. If you’ll give him work, that’s all you
can do for him. Good of you, Justin. I’ll not forget it.
I’ve got him on my conscience, you know.”</p>

<p>“Did he ask for work? Will he take it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He didn’t ask us for it. He’s got his
foolish pride. But he doesn’t know who you are. I
mean—that I’m friendly with you or anything. Mr.
Daniels wants him to stay in the neighborhood for a few
days. I think he’d be glad to get a job with you if he felt
you really needed him.”</p>

<p>“Then he’ll get a chance of one,” Justin said. “Probably
I can’t put him on specialized work. Did he mention
what his trade is?”</p>

<p>“No. He doesn’t look as though he’d had a trade.
Maybe he was studying for some profession.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. At the bunkhouse, maybe, or wandering
about the place. Shall I send for him?”</p>

<p>“No; I’d better meet him by chance and bring the
thing up casually, don’t you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Yes, that would be better,” she agreed.</p>

<p>Having finished breakfast, Merrick went out to run
down his man. He found presently a ragged young fellow
sitting on the tongue of an old wagon puffing nervously
at a cigarette.</p>

<p>The engineer nodded a good-morning at him and
stopped. “Not so hot as yesterday,” he said by way of
introduction.</p>

<p>“No,” assented the ragged one gloomily.</p>

<p>“I’ve learned that Sheriff Daniels wants you to stay
around a few days. I’m in charge of the Sweetwater
Dam irrigation project. We need men. Want a job?”</p>

<p>“If it’s one that suits me,” answered the tramp, eyeing
Merrick ungraciously. He recognized the man’s
strength and force. Every line of him, every glance,
every inflection of the voice helped to bear out the impression
of success he radiated. Clearly he was masterful
and dominant, but the younger man did not like him
less for that.</p>

<p>“What can you do? What’s your line?”</p>

<p>“I’m an engineer.”</p>

<p>“What kind?”</p>

<p>“I’ve done more bridge-building than anything
else.”</p>

<p>Merrick looked him over more carefully. “College
man?”</p>

<p>“Massachusetts Tech.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Merrick.”</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated a fraction of a second. “You
can call me Jones.”</p>

<p>“One of my men quit yesterday. Would you care to
take a try at it? It’s cement work.”</p>

<p>The man who had given his name as Jones was suffering
the tortures of the damned. He wanted a shot in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
arm to lift him out of himself, and he had thrown away
his supply of the drug. Just now everything else in the
world was unimportant beside this ravenous craving
that filled his whole being.</p>

<p>“I’d just as soon,” he said without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he sat beside Merrick in the runabout.
The car was taking the stiff grade of the road
which climbed the Flat Tops to the hills.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>ONE BAD HOMBRE MEETS ANOTHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Jake Prowers</span> looked grimly down upon the Flat
Tops from the Notch. He could see the full stretch of
the mesa and below it one end of Paradise Valley. The
windmill of the Diamond Bar K was shining in the sun,
miles away, flinging out heliographic signals that conformed
to no man-made code.</p>

<p>“Wonder how Clint is this mo’ning,” he said in a
high, squeaky voice that went congruously with the
small, twisted figure and the wrinkled, leathery face.</p>

<p>His <i>fidus Achates</i>, Don Black, shifted in the saddle to
ease himself and rested his weight on one stirrup. He
was a black-bearded, fierce-looking man in blue overalls,
faded flannel shirt, and run-down-at-the-heel boots.</p>

<p>“Didn’t know he was sick,” he said, chewing tobacco
imperturbably.</p>

<p>“Fellow shot him last night, by jiminy by jinks, an’
set fire to his wheat.”</p>

<p>“Did?” Black shot one startled, questioning look at
his employer.</p>

<p>Jake cackled with splenetic laughter. “No, sir. Don’t
you look at me thataway, Don. I hadn’t a thing to do
with it. If I’d ’a’ done it, it would ’a’ been done right.
This fellow was a tramp, they say. He didn’t get any
consid’rable amount of the wheat an’ he didn’t get
Clint.”</p>

<p>Fate had played a strange trick when it put the unscrupulous
and restless soul of a Lucifer in the warped
body of Jake Prowers, when it expressed that soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
through a thin, cracked voice and pale-blue, washed-out
eyes. To the casual observer he seemed one of life’s ineffectives.
Those who knew him best found reason to
shudder at his mirthless laughter and his mild oaths, at
the steady regard of his expressionless gaze. They seemed
somehow to stress by contrast the man’s dark and ruthless
soul. There were moments when from those cold eyes
flamed something sinister and blasting that chilled the
blood.</p>

<p>Black had been living for weeks at an out-of-the-way
cabin in the hills. He was riding herd on a bunch of
Prowers’s cattle feeding on the edge of the Government
reservation. Consequently he had been out of the way
of hearing the news of the community.</p>

<p>“What had this tramp got against Clint?” he asked,
firing accurately with tobacco juice at the face of a flat
rock.</p>

<p>“You know how high-headed Clint is. He beat up a
bunch of tramps an’ one came back to even up things.
Last night he took a whirl at it. The fellow set fire to
some wheat-stacks an’ gunned Clint when he showed up,
by the jumpin’ Jehosaphat. But Clint’s no invalid.
He’d take right smart killing, an’ all he got was one pill
in the leg. Trouble with most of these here bad men is
they ain’t efficient. When you lay for Clint, Don, I’d advise
you to spill about a pint of lead in him.”</p>

<p>The little man grinned with broken-toothed malevolence
at his henchman.</p>

<p>“I don’t aim to lay for Clint,” growled Black. He was
not a humorist and he never knew when Prowers’s jokes
were loaded with dynamite.</p>

<p>Jake cackled. “O’ course not. Clint, he’s a good citizen
if he did kick you off’n the Diamond Bar K once.
What’s a li’l’ thing like that between friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“I don’t claim him as any friend of mine. If you ask
me, he’s too dawg-goned bossy—got to have everything
his own way. But that ain’t sayin’ I got any notion
of layin’ in the brush for him. Not so any one could
notice it. If Clint lives till I bump him off, he’ll sure be a
Methuselah,” Black answered sulkily.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” jeered the cattleman. “I’ll tell Clint
to quit worryin’ about you—that you ain’t got a thing
against him. Everything’s lovely, even if he did kick
you around some.”</p>

<p>The rider flushed darkly. “He ain’t worryin’ none
about me, an’ I didn’t say everything was lovely. I like
him same as I do a wolf. But all I ask is for him to let
me alone. If he does that, we’ll not tangle.”</p>

<p>On the breeze there came to them from far to the left a
faint booming. Prowers looked toward the rocky escarpment
back of which lay the big dam under construction.</p>

<p>The wrinkled, leathery face told no tales. “Still
blasting away on his dinged dam project. That fellow
Merrick is either plumb fool or else we are. I got to find
out which.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he can’t make water run uphill,” the dark
man commented.</p>

<p>“No, Don. But maybe he doesn’t have to do that.
Maybe the Government engineers are wrong. I’ll admit
that don’t look reasonable to me. They put it down
in black and white—three of ’em, one after another—that
Elk Creek Cañon is higher at the far end than this
dam site of his. They dropped the scheme because it
wasn’t feasible. Probably Merrick’s one of these squirts
that know it all. Still—” The sentence died out, but
the man’s thoughts raced on.</p>

<p>Black desisted from chewing tobacco to hum a fragment
of a song he had cherished twenty-five years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Every daisy in the dell</div>
<div class="verse">Knows my story, knows it well,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>he murmured tunelessly.</p>

<p>“If he should be right, by jiminy by jinks—” Prowers
was talking to himself. He let the conditional clause
stand alone. Slowly the palm of his hand rasped back
and forth over a rough, unshaven chin.</p>

<p>“Did they catch this tramp that shot up Clint?”
asked Black.</p>

<p>“Not yet. Daniels is patrolling the railroad. If the
fellow hasn’t made his getaway on the night freight,
they’ll likely get him. He’s got to stick to the railway.”</p>

<p>“Why has he?” the rider inquired. He was watching
a moving object among the rocks below.</p>

<p>“So’s to skip the country. He ain’t acquainted here—knows
nothing about these hills. If he wasn’t taken
by some rancher and turned over to Daniels, he’d starve
to death. Likely he’s lying under cover somewheres
along the creek.”</p>

<p>“Likely he ain’t,” differed Black. “Likely he’s
ducked for the hills.” His gaze was still on the boulder
field below. From its case beside the saddle he drew a
rifle.</p>

<p>“Why would he do that?”</p>

<p>“I dunno why, except that a fellow on the dodge
can’t always choose the road he’s gonna travel. Any reward
for this guy?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t heard of any. Yore conscience joggin’ you to
light out and hunt for the man that shot up Clint, Don?”
his employer probed derisively.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have to hunt far, Jake,” the herder replied,
a note of triumph in the drawling voice. For once
he had got the better of the boss in a verbal duel. “He’s
right down there among the rocks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Down where?”</p>

<p>The barrel of the rifle pointed to a group of large
boulders which, in prehistoric days, perhaps, had broken
from the ledge above and rolled down.</p>

<p>“Don’t see any one,” Jake said after the pale-blue
eyes had watched the spot steadily for several moments.</p>

<p>“He’s seen us, an’ he’s lying hid. You keep him covered
while I go down and collect him.”</p>

<p>Prowers gave this consideration and vetoed the suggestion.
“No, you stay here, Don, and I’ll go get him.”</p>

<p>“If there’s any reward—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that. There ain’t gonna be
any reward.”</p>

<p>The ranchman swung down from the saddle and descended
from the bluff by way of a wooded gulch at the
right. Ten minutes later, Black saw him emerge and begin
to cross the rock slide toward the big boulders.</p>

<p>Presently Prowers stopped and shouted. “You fellow
in the rocks, I wantta talk with you.”</p>

<p>There came no answer.</p>

<p>He moved cautiously a little closer, rifle ready for action.
“We got you, fellow. Better come outa there an’
talk turkey. I don’t aim for to turn you over to the sheriff
if you’re anyways reasonable,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Wotcha want with me?” a voice called from the
rocks.</p>

<p>“Wantta have a pow-wow with you. Maybe you ’n’
me can do business together. No can tell.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Name’s Jake Prowers. No friend of Clint Reed if
that’s what’s eatin’ you?”</p>

<p>After a delay of several seconds, a figure appeared and
moved closer. The ranchman saw in the man’s hand the
gleam of an automatic revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>The fugitive stopped a few yards from Prowers and
eyed him suspiciously. “Wotcha want to chew the rag
about?” he asked.</p>

<p>Jake sat down on a rock with an air so casually careless
that a tenderfoot might not have guessed that he
was ready for instant action if need be.</p>

<p>“Fellow, sit down,” he said. “We got all day before
us. I don’t reckon you got any engagements you have
to keep immediate—not since you had that one at the
Diamond Bar K ranch last night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t getcha.”</p>

<p>“Sure you do. No use throwin’ a sandy with me. I
tell you, fellow, I’m playin’ my own hand. Me, I don’t
like Reed any more’n you do. So, entrey noo, as the
frog-eaters say, we’ll take it for granted you were the
uninvited guest at Reed’s ranch a few hours since. Yore
work wasn’t first-class, if you ask old Jake Prowers.
You didn’t burn but a small part of the wheat and you
didn’t get Clint anyways adequate.”</p>

<p>“Meaning he wasn’t croaked?” Cig demanded out of
the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>“I’ll say he wasn’t, by jiminy by jinks. But I don’t
know as that’ll help you any when his boys catch you.”</p>

<p>“They ain’t gonna catch me,” the New York crook
boasted, his brain seething with suspicion of the dried-up
little man in front of him.</p>

<p>Jake Prowers weighed this, a skeptical smile on his
thin lips. “Interesting, but unreliable,” he decided
aloud, in regard to the other’s prediction. “How do
you aim to prevent it? The sheriff has got you cut off
from the railroad. Food don’t grow on bushes in these
hills. You’re done, unless—”</p>

<p>“You gotta ’nother guess coming,” the thug retorted.
“Forget that stuff. I ain’t no hobo. Come to a showdown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
these country boobs’ll find me right there with a
gun. I’m a good man to lay off.”</p>

<p>The Westerner laughed, softly and derisively. “Fellow,
you talk plumb foolish. This ain’t New York. It’s
Colorado. That popgun of yours ain’t worth a billy be
damn. Why, I could pick you off right now an’ never
take a chance. Or my man could do it from the ledge up
there. But say, for the sake of argument, we let you go.
Say you ain’t found by any posse or cowpuncher. What’s
the end of the trail you’re following? It don’t lead anywhere
but round an’ round in a circle. You got nothing to
eat and no place to go for food. Maybe you can stick it
out a week. Then you’re done.”</p>

<p>“I might get to a town and jump a freight.”</p>

<p>“Not a chance. In a country like this news spreads in
all directions. There ain’t a man within fifty miles but
has his eyes peeled for you. No, sir, you’re in Dutch.”</p>

<p>Cig felt his helplessness, in spite of the bluff he was
putting up. This land of wide spaces, of a thousand hills
and valleys, shook his confidence. In New York he
would have known what to do, but here he was a child.
The shrunken little man finished in brown leather was
giving him straight facts and he knew it.</p>

<p>“Nothing to that. Say, old Jonah, do I look like I
had a yellow streak?” the New York tough demanded.</p>

<p>“All right. Suits me if it does you.” Jake rose and
waved a hand airily into space. “Drift right along, my
friend. I’ll not keep you—not for a minute. But when
you come to the end of yore trail, you’ll remember that
you had one good bet you wouldn’t back because you’re
one of these wise guys that know it all.”</p>

<p>The fugitive listened with sullen resentment. He did
not want to trust this old man. His instinct told him
that, if he did so, Prowers would be for the time at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
his master. But he was driven by circumstances which
gave him no choice.</p>

<p>“I ain’t said I wouldn’t listen to you, have I?” he
growled.</p>

<p>Prowers sat down again on the rock. “If I help you,
we’ve got to come to an understanding right now. It’ll
be a business deal. I hide you an’ feed you. Some day
I’ll need you. When I do, you’ll take orders like a lamb.
If that ain’t agreeable to you, why, all you got to do is
start on yore travels now.”</p>

<p>“Need me what for?” demanded Cig.</p>

<p>Into the mild, skim-milk eyes of the cattleman there
flashed for an instant an expression of cold cruelty
scarcely human. As Prowers’s thin lip smile met Cig,
the tramp still felt the shock of that ruthless ferocity.</p>

<p>“How the jumpin’ Jehosaphat do I know?” the old
man said suavely, almost in a murmur. “For murder,
massacre, or mayhem. Not yore business, my friend.
All you’ve got to do is jump when I say so. Understand?”</p>

<p>Cig felt a cold sinking of the heart. He belonged to
the dregs of humanity, but he knew that this mild old
man was his master in villainy. It was as though he
were smoking a cigarette with a keg of gunpowder scattered
all around him. Jake Prowers was a center of danger
almost Olympic in possibilities.</p>

<p>“I dunno about that,” the crook snarled.</p>

<p>Again the wrinkled hand of the ranchman lifted in a
gesture that included all space. “The world’s before
you,” he said ironically. “The peace of the hills go with
you while you hunt for a nice lonesome gulch as a coffin.”</p>

<p>“What do I get out of it if we do business? Or do
youse figure on workin’ me for a sucker?”</p>

<p>Jake had won, and he knew it. “Now you’re talkin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
sense, my friend. You’ll find me no tightwad. I pay
for what I get, and I pay big.” An ominous flash of
warning was in his eyes as he leaned forward and spoke
slowly and softly. “But if you throw me down—if
there’s a finger crook about you that ain’t on the level
with me—better say yore prayers backward and forward.
No man ever double-crossed Jake Prowers an’ got
away with it. It ain’t being done in this neck of the
woods.”</p>

<p>Hardy villain though he was, Cig felt a shiver go down
his spine. He was superstitious, as all criminals are.
He had the feeling that some one was walking on his
grave, that this wrinkled old devil had been appointed
by fate to put a period to his evil ways and days.</p>

<p>He shook off the wave of foreboding and slouched forward,
slipping the automatic into his coat pocket. “I’ll
play square, boss, if you do. See me through an’ I’ll go
the limit for you. It’s a bargain.”</p>

<p>Jake shook hands on it.</p>

<p>“Done, by jiminy by jinks,” he said in his high weak
voice.</p>

<p>Cig was puzzled and a little annoyed. How had he
ever been fooled into thinking that this inoffensive little
specimen was dangerous? It was written on him that he
would not hurt a fly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE HOMESTEADER SERVES NOTICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> later years the man who had called himself Tug
Jones looked back on the days and nights that followed
as a period of unmitigated dejection and horror. The
craving for the drug was with him continually. If he had
had a supply on hand, he would have yielded a hundred
times to the temptation to use it. But he had burned
the bridges behind him. There was no way to get the
stuff without going in person to a town of some size.</p>

<p>This meant not only a definite surrender of the will,
but a promise of relief that could not be fulfilled inside of
twenty-four hours at the earliest. Just now this stretch
of time was a period of torment as endless as a year.</p>

<p>Somehow he stuck it out, though he spent much of
his time in an inferno of feverish desire. He tried to kill
the appetite with work. Merrick, moving to and fro
with a keen eye on the men, observed that the foreman
was sloughing his work and letting it fall on Jones. At
the end of the week, Merrick discharged him and raised
the former tramp to his place as foreman. Jones accepted
the promotion without thanks. He knew he had
earned it, but he did not care whether he received it or
not.</p>

<p>He grew worn and haggard. Dark shadows emphasized
the hollows of the tortured eyes. So irritable was
his temper that at a word it flashed to explosion. By
disposition he was not one to pass on to subordinates the
acerbity that was a residue of the storm that was shaking
him. A sense of justice had always been strong in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
him. Fifty times a day he clamped his teeth to keep
back the biting phrase. In general he succeeded, but
malingerers found him a hard taskmaster.</p>

<p>They appealed to Merrick and got small comfort from
him. The new cement foreman was getting the work
done both rapidly and well. That was all the chief engineer
asked of him. The details could be arranged by
Jones as he pleased.</p>

<p>The nights were the worst. During the day he had
the work to occupy his mind, but when darkness fell
over the hills its shadows crept over his soul. He could
not sleep. Sometimes he borrowed technical books from
Merrick and tried to bury himself in study. More often
he tramped till physical exhaustion drove him back to
his cot to stare up sleeplessly at the canvas roof of his
tent.</p>

<p>Suffering wears itself out at last. There came a time
when the edge of the craving grew less keen, when its attack
was less frequent. In the pure, untempered air of
the hills the cement gang foreman came to sounder
health. His appetite increased with his physical stamina.
One day it struck him with a little shock of surprise
that he had not had one of his racking headaches
for two weeks. He began to sleep better, though there
were still nights when he had to tramp the hills in self-defense.</p>

<p>Inevitably during those days the foreman found himself
studying the project upon which Merrick had
staked his reputation. As an engineer he took off his hat
to the efficiency with which his chief got results. Merrick
was a driver, but he was more than that. He had
the fighting spirit that lifts from defeat to victory.
Good engineers had said it was not feasible to water the
Flat Tops by means of ditches carrying water from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
drainage area above. Justin Merrick had not accepted
their verdict. He had made his own surveys and meant
to demonstrate that they were wrong.</p>

<p>He knew that a certain group of cattlemen, under the
leadership of old Jake Prowers, were watching him sullenly.
They believed, from the surveys made by Government
engineers, that the grade made it impossible
to bring water from the dam through Elk Creek Cañon
to the mesa below. Yet Merrick knew, too, that they
were uneasy. It was on the cards that the Reclamation
Service experts might be wrong in their surveys. If
Prowers discovered that they were, Justin felt sure he
would move to ruthless and dynamic action.</p>

<p>The big dam was practically finished. Merrick kept
a night guard over it and the tools. Sometimes, after
supper, he strolled down to look it over and think out
under the quiet stars the problems of supplies or canal
construction. It was on such a night visit that he came
face to face with the new concrete work foreman.</p>

<p>The superintendent of construction had been watching
Tug Jones. He had found out that the man was one
who would accept responsibility and could be trusted to
get efficient results without supervision. Twice he had
taken him from the work he had in charge and given
him engineering difficulties to solve. Each time the man
from Massachusetts Tech had eliminated the tangle in
the clearest and simplest way.</p>

<p>Merrick was not given to asking advice of his subordinates,
no matter how capable they might be. To-night
he simply made an announcement of a detail in his
plans that involved the foreman.</p>

<p>“About time we began work on Elk Creek Cañon,
Jones,” he said. “I’m going to put you in charge and
run the ditch line through right away. We may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
trouble there. That fellow Prowers had one of his men, a
rider named Don Black, file a homestead claim right in
the cañon. It won’t stick. He knows that, but he wants
some ground to fight us. Look out for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the foreman.</p>

<p>The habit of mind of the Massachusetts Tech man was
to be thorough. He studied the surveys very closely and
went over the ground carefully from the dam site to the
cañon entrance. The conclusion was forced upon him
that Merrick had made a mistake. The grade through
the hills to Elk Creek Cañon would not do. He could
put his finger on the very spot that made it impossible.</p>

<p>It was hard for him to believe that Merrick had made
a blunder so vital to the success of the enterprise. He
checked up his figures a second time and made a re-survey
of that part of the line. There was no possible doubt
about it. Since water will not run uphill by gravity, it
could not flow from the dam to the upper entrance of
the cañon.</p>

<p>He reported to his chief what he had discovered.</p>

<p>Merrick took this facer with no least hint of dismay.
So far as his strong, square-cut visage gave any expression,
it was one of impatience.</p>

<p>“Suppose you leave that to me, Jones,” he said
curtly. “I know what I’m doing. What I’m asking of
you is to determine the best path for the ditch along the
side of the cañon. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“But if you can’t get the water to the cañon—”</p>

<p>“That’s my business. You’re not responsible for that.”</p>

<p>There remained nothing more to be said. Jones carried
away with him the knowledge that his chief had
flatly declined to give weight to his findings. He could
either resign or he could do as he was told.</p>

<p>The younger man was puzzled. Was it possible that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Merrick, after all, was a pig-headed four-flusher? That
he could be a pretentious incompetent fed up with a
sense of infallibility?</p>

<p>To see him on the work was a refutal of this view. He
was an egoist through and through. To look at the salient
jaw, into the cool, flinty eyes, was to recognize the
man’s self-sufficiency. He was dominant and masterful.
But it was hard to believe that his shrewd, direct, untiring
energy masked any incapacity. He did not seem to
have the quality of mind that is content to fool itself.</p>

<p>Tug knew that his chief had a much wider experience
in engineering than he. This project must have been
studied by him from every angle, all difficulties considered,
all technical problems solved. Yet the fact stood
in the way like a Rock of Gibraltar that water flows
downhill and not up.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and stepped out from under.
Merrick had told him with cool finality that it was
none of his business. That was true. He had done his
full duty when he reported the matter to the chief. He
turned his attention to running the ditch line through
the gorge.</p>

<p>To save time he moved his outfit to Elk Creek. A
chuck wagon, mule teams, scrapers, and necessary supplies
followed the little group of surveyors. Within a
week the sound of blasting echoed from wall to wall of
the ravine.</p>

<p>Two men rode up the defile to the engineer’s camp
one sunny morning. Jones, in flannel shirt, corduroys,
and high laced boots, directed operations as the workmen
set out on the day’s work.</p>

<p>One of the visitors to the camp was a long, black-bearded,
fierce-eyed man in blue overalls. The other
was a mild little fellow in years well past middle age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>The dark man introduced himself rudely. “What the
blue blazes you doing here? This is my homestead. You
trying to jump my claim?”</p>

<p>The engineer met this brusque attack suavely. During
the past weeks, as he had slowly fought his way back
toward self-respect, the defiance and the bitter irony had
disappeared from his manner. He was recovering the
poise that characterizes the really able man of affairs
when he is subjected to annoyance and worry.</p>

<p>“You are Mr. Donald Black?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m him. An’ I’m here to say that no man—I
don’t care if he is backed by a big corporation—can
jump my property an’ get away with it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we have any intention of prejudicing
your rights, Mr. Black,” the engineer answered. “Of
course, I’m only an employee. Mr. Merrick is the man
you ought to see. You’ll find him up at the dam.”</p>

<p>“I’m servin’ notice on you right here an’ now to get
off my land. I’m givin’ you till night to get yore whole
outfit outa here. I ain’t a-going to see anybody. Understand?
You’ve got me in one word short an’ sweet—git.”</p>

<p>The dried-up little man beside Black let out a cracked
cackle of laughter. “Seems like that should ought to be
plain enough,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Tug looked at the wrinkled cattleman. He guessed
that this was Jake Prowers, of whose sinister reputation
rumors had reached him. But it was to Black he spoke.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, perhaps, you had better see a lawyer?
There’s always a legal way to straighten out difficulties
that—”</p>

<p>“Lawyer!” exploded Black with an oath. “Listen,
fellow! I don’t aim for to see no lawyer. You’d like fine
to tie this up in the courts while you went right on building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
yore end gates an’ runnin’ yore ditches on my land.
No, sir. Cattle was here first, an’ we don’t aim to let you
chase us off. See?”</p>

<p>“I expect the law will have to decide that, Mr. Black.
But that’s merely an opinion of mine. I’m here to run a
ditch through this cañon—an employee hired at so
much a week. Unless I get orders to stop work, the
ditch will be dug.” Jones spoke evenly, without raising
his voice, but there was a ring of finality in his tone.</p>

<p>“You crow damn loud,” Black retorted angrily.
“Think I don’ know who you are—a good-for-nothin’
tramp liable to go to the pen for burnin’ up wheat an’
bush-whackin’ Clint Reed? You’re all swelled up, ain’t
you? Forget it, fellow. I’m givin’ you orders to clear
out. If you don’t, some of you’re liable to be sorry. This
here is a man’s country.”</p>

<p>Tug looked straight at the rawboned, dark man.
“Meaning?” he asked pointedly.</p>

<p>Prowers answered. He knew that enough had been
said. More would be surplusage and might carry the
danger of a come-back in case men should be killed.</p>

<p>“You’d be sorry to beat a pore man outa his claim,
wouldn’t you?” he said, tee-heeing with virulent
laughter. “Come on, Don. Might as well be pushin’ on
our reins.”</p>

<p>Over his shoulder the homesteader flung a last word
that might be taken as a threat, a warning, or a prophecy.
“Till to-night, Mr. Hobo.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE STAMPEDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones</span> sent a messenger to his chief with word of Don
Black’s threat, and Merrick at once rode to Elk Creek
to consult with the man he had put in charge.</p>

<p>“Do they mean to attack you? Is that what you
gathered from what he said?” asked the chief engineer
of his assistant.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. Prowers smoothed over what Black
said. I judge he didn’t want to go on record as having
made any threats. But the last thing the big fellow
yelled at me was that we had till to-night to get out.”</p>

<p>“Good of him to give you warning. What do you
suggest, Jones?”</p>

<p>“Give me half a dozen rifles and I’ll hold the fort,”
the younger man replied, eyes gleaming. “Double the
gang and let me rush the work.”</p>

<p>Merrick shook his head. “No, this isn’t a little
private war we’re having. Think I’ll just let you sit
tight and see what happens. Prowers isn’t likely to go
far to start with.”</p>

<p>“Suits me, but don’t blame me if they drive us out.
I’m rather looking for a bunch of armed cowboys to
descend upon us.”</p>

<p>“In which case you’ll enter a formal protest and retire
in good order without resistance. The law’s with
us. I filed our maps and plans with the Land Office
before Black homesteaded. He obviously took up this
quarter section only to hamper us.”</p>

<p>“Will it delay you much?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Justin Merrick smiled, a rather peculiar smile that
suggested a knowledge of facts not on the surface. “I
don’t think so, but there’s no reason why Prowers
shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Rather tame surrender, wouldn’t it be? If you’re
within your rights, why not stand our ground and fight
them off?”</p>

<p>“For the moral effect, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Isn’t it a sign of weakness for us to hoist the
white flag after the first brush?”</p>

<p>“That’s a point of view. We’re playing for position.
Let Prowers break the law and get in wrong. If we’re
armed and looking for trouble, we don’t come into court
with clean hands ourselves. I’d rather let him show his
plan of campaign. Even though we should be driven out,
we can come back whenever we want to. He can’t keep
his men here and hold the gulch.”</p>

<p>“No. At least he won’t.”</p>

<p>The man who had fought in Flanders was not satisfied.
The irrigation company was in the right. Prowers
and the group of men with him were obstructionists,
trying to hold back the progress of the country for their
own selfish ends. They were outside the law, though
they were using it as a cover. The policy to be expected
of Merrick would have been bolder, less opportunistic.
Why had the chief marched his men up the hill, like
the King of France in the rhyme, only to march them
down again? This did not seem to go well with his
salient, fighting jaw.</p>

<p>Since it was his business to obey orders and not to
ask for reasons, Tug said no more. He understood that
Merrick was holding back something from him, and he
had no desire whatever to force a confidence.</p>

<p>Merrick rode back to the dam and left his subordinate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
in charge of the camp. Throughout the day work went
on uninterrupted. At dusk the surveyors and ditch-diggers
returned to the draw where the tents had been
set. At this point of the gorge the wall fell back and a
slope led to the rim above.</p>

<p>At the summit of this rise the engineer posted a sentry
with orders to fire a revolver in case of an attack.
Two other guards were set, one at each mouth of the
cañon. At the expiration of four hours, these were
relieved by relays. At midnight, and again in the chill
pre-dawn hours, Jones himself made a round of the
posts to see that all was well.</p>

<p>He had scarcely lain down after the second tour
when the crack of a revolver sounded. Tug leaped to his
feet and was drawing on a boot before the echoes had
died away.</p>

<p>As he ducked out from the tent flap, revolver in hand,
a glance showed him scantily clad men spilling from
their sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>“What is it? Where are they?” some one yelled.</p>

<p>A light breeze was stirring. On it was borne a faint
rumble as of thunder. It persisted—seemed to be
rolling nearer. The sound deepened to a steady roar.
Tug’s startled glance swept the cañon sword cleft.
Could there have been a cloudburst in the hills? The
creek bed was still dry. His eyes swung round to the
saddle ridge of the draw above him.</p>

<p>A living tidal wave was pouring across the rim and
down the draw. Hundreds of backs tossed up and down
like the swell of a troubled sea. Though he had never
seen one before, the engineer knew that the camp was in
the path of a cattle stampede.</p>

<p>He shouted a warning and raced for the higher ground
at the edge of the draw. The men scattered to escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
from the path of that charging avalanche. They were in
a panic of fear. If any were caught beneath the impact
of those scores of galloping hoofs, they would be
crushed to death instantly. Startled oaths and staccato
shouts rang out. An anguished yell of terror lifted itself
shrilly. A running man had stumbled and gone down.</p>

<p>The thud of the hoofs died away. The stampede had
swept down into the dry bed of the stream and swung
to the right. It left behind it a devastated camp.
Tents had been torn down and ripped to pieces. Cots
were smashed to kindling. From the overturned chuck
wagon scattered food lay trampled into the ground by
sharp feet. The surveying instruments were broken
beyond repair.</p>

<p>A huddled mass lay motionless in the track of the
avalanche. Tug knelt beside it and looked into the battered
outline of what a few moments earlier had been
a man’s face quick with life. No second glance was
necessary to see that the spirit had passed out of the
crushed body. The engineer recognized him by the
clothes. His name was Coyle. He had been a harmless
old fellow of many quips and jests, one full of the milk
of human kindness. He, too, had fought against his
weakness, a fondness for liquor that had all his life kept
him down. Now, in a moment, his smiles and his battles
were both ended.</p>

<p>Jones straightened the twisted body and the sprawling
limbs before he covered the face with a handkerchief.
He rose and looked grimly round at the group of
appalled men whose blanched faces made a gray semi-circle
in the faint light of coming dawn. They were a
rough-and-ready lot. Most of them had seen the lives
of fellow workmen snuffed out suddenly. But this had
come like a bolt from heaven. Each of them knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
it might have been he lying there; that if the boss had
not set a watch, the stampede would have destroyed
many of them. The shock of it still chilled the heart.</p>

<p>“They’ve murdered poor Coyle,” the engineer said,
and his voice was a solemn accusation.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked one, startled.</p>

<p>“These cattle didn’t gather up there by themselves.
They were rounded up and stampeded over the crest.”</p>

<p>“Jake Prowers!” exclaimed a mule-skinner.</p>

<p>“We’ll name no names yet, boys, not till we’ve put
it up to Mr. Merrick.” The camp boss glanced up the
hill. The sound of some one running had reached his
ears. “Here comes Jensen. We’ll hear what he has to
say.”</p>

<p>Jensen confirmed the charge of the engineer. He had
heard voices, shots, the crack of whips, and then the
thundering rush of cattle. He had fired once and fled
for the safety of the rocks. The stampede had stormed
past and down the slope. But he had seen and heard
no more of the men who had been exciting the wild hill
cattle to a panic of terror. They had disappeared in the
darkness.</p>

<p>The engineer made arrangements for carrying the
body of Coyle to the dam and sent a messenger to
notify Merrick of what had taken place. This done, he
climbed to the saddle of the draw with the intention
of investigating the lay of the land where the stampede
had started. He knew that, if he were only expert enough
to read it, the testimony written there would convict
those who had done this crime.</p>

<p>At work of this sort he was a child. He was from the
East, and he knew nothing of reading sign. Stamped
in mud, with outlines clear-cut and sharp, he would
have known, of course, a pony’s tracks from those of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
steer. But unfortunately the marks imprinted on the
short brittle grass were faint and fragmentary. They
told no story to Jones.</p>

<p>He quartered over the ground carefully, giving his
whole mind to the open page which Nature had spread
before him and covered with her handwriting. Concentration
was not enough. It was written in a language
of which he had not learned the vocabulary.
Reluctantly he gave up the attempt. Sheriff Daniels
was a Westerner, an old cattleman, skilled at cutting
sign. This was a problem for him to solve if he could.</p>

<p>It was afternoon when the sheriff arrived. He had
made one discovery before reaching the camp. A cow
had broken a leg in the stampede and lay helpless in the
bed of Elk Creek. The brand on it was the Diamond
Bar K.</p>

<p>“Fine business,” he commented dryly. “Clint’s
enemies try to bust up the irrigation proposition he’s
interested in by stampedin’ his own cattle down the
draw here. Maybe we can find out the <i>hombres</i> that
rounded up a bunch of his stock yesterday. That’d
help some.”</p>

<p>If the sheriff discovered anything from his examination
of the lane over which the stampede had swept, he
did not confide in either Jones or Merrick. Like many
men who have lived much in the open, he had a capacity
for reticence. He made his observations unhurriedly
and rode away without returning to the camp.</p>

<p>Merrick gave his assistant orders to break camp
and return to the dam. A force was still to continue at
work in the cañon, but the men would be taken up and
brought back each day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>HIS PICTURE IN THE PAPER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Summer</span> had burned to autumn. The first frosts had
crisped the foliage of the quaking asps and the cottonwoods
to a golden glory in tune with the halcyon
Indian summer. Faint threats of coming winter could
be read in an atmosphere grown more pale and sharp,
in coloring less rich and warm.</p>

<p>Betty could count the time in months now since she
had sent her salvaged tramp into the hills to help her
lover wrestle with the problems of the Sweetwater Dam
project. It was still a joy to her that she had been intuitively
right about him. He was making good. He had
brains and ability and the power of initiative which
marks the strong man from the subordinate. Justin
admitted this generously, giving her credit for a keener
insight than his own.</p>

<p>But that was not the best of it. She knew now,
through Merrick, what the vice was that had dragged
him down: and from the same source she learned that
he had so far fought his campaign out to victory. Not
since the day after her father had been shot had she
seen the young man, but she wished she could send him
a message of good cheer and faith.</p>

<p>She thought of him a good deal. She was thinking of
him this morning as she cleaned the pantry shelves and
substituted new papers for the old. Justin had been
down the evening before and had told her of the threat
Prowers had made through Don Black in case the young
engineer did not evacuate the cañon. It was in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
character to look for good rather than ill in men, but she
had a conviction that the cackling little cattleman was a
sink of iniquity. He would do evil without ruth. There
was, she felt, something demoniac, unhuman about him.</p>

<p>How far would he go to begin with? She did not know,
but she was glad Justin had given orders to retire from
Elk Creek in case of attack. His reasons she appreciated
and approved. He was no hothead, but a cool, hard-hitting,
determined fighter. In the end he would win, no
matter what difficulties were thrown in his way. She
could not think of Justin in any way except as a success.
He was the kind of man who succeeds in whatever he
undertakes.</p>

<p>The telephone rang. Her father, at Wild Horse, was
on the line.</p>

<p>“There’s been trouble at the cañon,” he explained.
“I’ve been talkin’ with Daniels. Merrick has sent for
him. A man was killed—some one working on the job.
Haven’t heard any particulars yet. I’ll let you know
if I do.”</p>

<p>“Killed—on purpose, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t hear who?”</p>

<p>“Daniels doesn’t know.”</p>

<p>Betty returned to her work very much disturbed in
mind. There was no reason for assuming that the man
who had been killed was her redeemed vagrant, but
she could not get this possibility out of her mind. He
would be in the forefront of danger if there was any.
She knew him well enough for that.</p>

<p>She tried to get Merrick on the telephone, but the
word that came down to her from the dam was that he
had ridden to Elk Creek. Did the assistant superintendent
know when he would be back? No, he did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Tremulously Betty asked another question. “Have
you heard, Mr. Atchison, who the man is that was
killed?”</p>

<p>“His name’s Coyle—a man sent out to us by an
employment agency in Denver.”</p>

<p>Betty leaned against the wall a moment after she had
hung up the receiver. She was greatly relieved, and in
the reaction from the strain under which she had been
holding herself tautly felt oddly weak.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a goose!” she told herself with stinging
candor. “What does it matter to you who it was?”</p>

<p>But she knew it mattered a great deal. Nobody had
ever stimulated her imagination as this tramp had. Her
liking for Justin was of quite another sort. It had not in
it the quality that set pulses pounding. She would have
denied to herself indignantly that she did not love him.
If not, why was she engaged to him? But her affection
was a well-ordered and not a disturbing force. This
was as it should be, according to her young philosophy.
She gave herself with energy and enthusiasm to the
many activities of life. The time had not yet come when
love was for her a racing current sweeping to its goal so
powerfully that there could be no dalliance by the way.</p>

<p>Betty moved the dishes from the last shelf. As she
started to gather the soiled newspaper folded across the
plank, her glance fell upon the picture of a soldier in
uniform. The eyes that looked into hers were those of
the man who had called himself Tug Jones.</p>

<p>Her breath caught as she read. The caption beneath
the photograph was, “Captain Thurston K. Hollister,
awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for Gallantry
in France.” The story below mentioned the fact that
the man who had been given this recognition had disappeared
and could not be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>The girl’s blood sang. She had known from that
first day he was of good blood, but she had not been
sure that his record was worthy of him. He had not
only fought in France; he had covered himself with
glory. It was almost too good to be true.</p>

<p>She was on the porch to meet her father before he
had swung down from the saddle. He told her details of
the affair at Elk Creek as far as he had heard them.</p>

<p>Betty had cut the Hollister story out of the paper. She
handed it to her father, all but the picture folded under.</p>

<p>“Who is this, Daddy?”</p>

<p>Reed glanced at it and answered promptly. “Looks
like that young fellow Jones.”</p>

<p>Triumphantly she nodded. “That’s who it is. Read
what it says about him.”</p>

<p>The cattleman read. “Hmp!” he grunted. “An’ I
called him a slacker.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter now what you called him, Dad.
But I’m awf’ly glad he wasn’t one.”</p>

<p>“Some li’l’ stunt that—breakin’ up a German
machine-gun nest and sittin’ tight for two days under
fire till the boys reached him.” Clint smiled sardonically,
the memory of the tongue-lashing he had given
this man still vividly with him. “I reckon I can be
more kinds of a durn fool in an hour than ’most anybody
you know, Bess.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad he’s making good with Justin. I just
knew he was a splendid fellow.”</p>

<p>“I’m so dawg-goned hot-headed. Can’t wait an’ give
myself time to cool off,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“He told Justin about it. The doctors gave him a lot
of morphine or something when he was wounded and he
got in the habit of using it to relieve the pain. Before he
knew it he couldn’t stop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“You’d think I’d learn a lick or two of sense, an’ me
’most fifty.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t touched the stuff since he went up to the
dam. Justin says it must have been horrible for him.
Some nights he kept walking till morning.”</p>

<p>“What else was it I called him besides a slacker—after
I’d beat him up till he couldn’t stand, an’ him a
sick man at that?”</p>

<p>Betty laughed at the way each of them, absorbed in
a personal point of view, was carrying on a one-sided
conversation.</p>

<p>“Are you going up to Elk Creek to-day, Dad? If
you are, I wish you’d let me go along.”</p>

<p>“I was thinkin’ about it. Like to go, would you?
All right. We might drive and take Ruthie.”</p>

<p>“That’d be fine. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>Betty flew into the house to get ready.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>A HOT TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheriff Daniels</span> rode across the hogback above Elk
Creek to a small ranch recently taken up by a homesteader,
much to the annoyance of Jake Prowers. He
found the man in a shed that served temporarily as a
barn.</p>

<p>Here a cow was proudly licking a very wobbly calf.</p>

<p>“’Lo, Sheriff. How’re things comin’ with you? Fine
an’ dandy?”</p>

<p>“No complaint, Howard. Had an increase in yore
herd, looks like.”</p>

<p>“Yessir, though it didn’t look much thataway ’bout
three o’clock this mo’ning a.m.”</p>

<p>“Come near losing her?”</p>

<p>“Bet I did. Both of ’em. But you never can tell, as
the old sayin’ is. I stayed with it, an’ everything’s all
right now.”</p>

<p>“I come across the hogback to have a chin with
Black. Know whether he’s home?” the officer asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t. He passed down the road whilst I
was up with old bossie here right early.”</p>

<p>The sheriff complimented his humor by repeating it.
“At three o’clock this mo’ning a.m.?”</p>

<p>“Yessir. I figured he must be going somewheres to be
settin’ off at that time o’ day.”</p>

<p>“Alone, was he?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, I reckon there was some one with him.”</p>

<p>Daniels threw a leg across a feed-rack, drew out a
knife from his pocket, and began to sharpen it on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
leather of his boot. “Dark as all git out, wasn’t it?
How’d you know it was Don?”</p>

<p>The homesteader grinned. “Every daisy in the dell
knows his story too darned well,” he parodied.</p>

<p>“Singin’ ‘Sweet Marie,’ was he?”</p>

<p>“Yep. Say, what kind of a mash would you feed her?
She’s right feverish yet, I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p>The sheriff gave advice out of his experience before he
came back ten minutes later to a subject that interested
him more.</p>

<p>“Don was out rounding-up cattle yesterday, wasn’t
he? Seems some one told me so.”</p>

<p>“Likely enough. He was away from the shack all
day. Wasn’t home by dark. I seen a light up there
somewheres about nine-thirty.”</p>

<p>The officer rode up to the cabin Black was using.
The door was hospitably unlatched, but nobody was
at home. Daniels walked in and looked around. It
was both dirty and untidy, but it told no tales of what
its occupant had been doing in the past twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Daniels remounted, skirted the edge of the Government
reserve, and descended a draw which led into a
small gorge almost concealed by a grove of young quaking
asps. This received its name from box elders growing
up the sides. If Black and his friends had rounded up
a bunch of cattle during the day, and wanted to
keep them unobserved until they could be stampeded
into Elk Creek Cañon, there was no handier spot to
hold them than in this little gulch. The sheriff had
ridden these hills too many years as a cattleman not to
know the country like a familiar book. In his youth,
while riding as a puncher for Prowers, he and a companion
had been caught in a blizzard and reached Box<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Elder Cañon in time to save themselves by building a
fire. Since then he had been here many times.</p>

<p>A one-room log cabin clung to the slope at the edge of
the quaking asps. It had been built by a hermit prospector
thirty years before, and had many times in the
intervening years been the refuge of belated punchers.</p>

<p>The officer walked in through the sagging door. On
the floor was a roll of soiled blankets. Greasy dishes and
remnants of food were on the home-made table. Three
persons had eaten here as late as this morning. He could
tell that by the live coals among the charred ends of
wood in the fireplace. Also, the lard left in the frying-pan
had not yet hardened.</p>

<p>Daniels made deductions. Of the three, one had
spent the night here to keep an eye on the cattle, assuming
that his guess about the herd was a correct one. The
other two had ridden up to Black’s cabin and slept
there, returning in the early morning for the drive to
Elk Creek.</p>

<p>From the cabin the sheriff walked down into the
bottom of the gulch. There was plenty of evidence to
show that a large number of cattle had been here very
recently. He followed the trail they made out of the
cañon to the mesa and saw that it headed toward Elk
Creek. He could not be quite sure, but he believed that
three horsemen rode after them. The character of the
ground made certainty impossible. The tracks were all
faint and blurred. Daniels followed them for two or
three miles to the rim of the draw down which the
frightened herd had been stampeded.</p>

<p>The sheriff rode across the hills to the Circle J P
ranch. He found Jake Prowers and Don Black greasing
a wagon.</p>

<p>Black looked up as the officer came around the corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
of the house and thrust his hand beneath the belt of his
trousers. Prowers said something to him in a low voice
and the hand came out empty.</p>

<p>Daniels rode up and looked down at them. He gave a
little nod of greeting.</p>

<p>“How do, Jake—Don? I dropped over to talk with
you about that business in Elk Creek Cañon,” he said.</p>

<p>“What about it?” asked Black suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I’d like to hear all you know about it.”</p>

<p>Prowers answered promptly and smoothly. “I don’t
know a thing about it, if you’re meanin’ me, except
what I’ve heard over the ’phone. The story is, some
cattle stampeded an’ a fellow got in their way—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know the story, Jake,” the sheriff interrupted
quietly. “I’m askin’ you what you can tell me about
that stampede.”</p>

<p>“Me! Why pick on me?” the wrinkled little man
piped. “Didn’t I tell you I didn’t know a thing about
it?”</p>

<p>“How about you, Don?” asked Daniels.</p>

<p>“Don don’ know a thing—”</p>

<p>“Talk for himself, can’t he, Jake?” the sheriff wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“Don’t get on the prod, Frank,” advised the owner of
the Circle J P. Voice and manner were still mild and
harmless.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Daniels, smiling. “How about it,
Don?”</p>

<p>Black met his steady gaze sulkily. “Didn’t know
there was a stampede till Jake told me so after he’d
been at the ’phone.”</p>

<p>“I expect you’ll have a chance to prove that, Don. I
got to arrest you.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded the dark man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“For causing the death of that fellow in the cañon
this mo’ning by stampeding cattle down the draw.”</p>

<p>“Any evidence, Frank?” This from Prowers, on
whose face a thin lip smile rested.</p>

<p>“Some. Don made threats yesterday. He spent the
day rounding-up cattle and drove ’em into Box Elder
Cañon for the night. About nine in the evening he
reached home an’ ate supper there, him and another
fellow. They took the road back to the cañon before
daybreak this mo’ning—not later than three o’clock.
A friend of theirs stayed in the old Thorwaldson cabin
to watch the stock. They ate breakfast with him.”</p>

<p>A flicker of fire burned in the skim-milk eyes. “My,
Frank, you know a lot. Anything more?”</p>

<p>“Some things I don’t know, I only guess, Jake. I
know Don an’ his friends had ham and cornbread and
coffee for breakfast, but I don’t know yet who his two
friends are.”</p>

<p>“Only guess that, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Jake.”</p>

<p>“You’ll know that soon,” jeered Prowers. “Any one
with an imagination active as yore’s won’t let a li’l’
thing like facts stand in his way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to take Don down to Wild Horse with me,”
Daniels replied impassively.</p>

<p>“That’s yore business,” the old cattleman said.
“You’re makin’ a mistake. Don spent the night with
me, if you want to know.”</p>

<p>“Sure you didn’t spend it with him?”</p>

<p>“You arrestin’ me, too, Frank?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Only guessin’ at me?”</p>

<p>“I’m not doing my guessin’ out loud—not all of it.”
Prowers’s splenetic laugh cackled. “You’d ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
get one o’ these brass stars from a detective agency, by
jiminy by jinks. A fellow that can mind-read Don here
an’ tell what he had for breakfast is a sure-enough sleuth
and no ornery sheriff.”</p>

<p>The old cattleman’s irony did not disturb Daniels.
“I know what he had for breakfast because I saw the
fry-pan an’ the dishes.”</p>

<p>“Better go slap a saddle on yore horse, Don,” jeered
Prowers. “Frank’s arrestin’ you because you had ham
an’ cornbread an’ coffee for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“You know why I’m arrestin’ him. He’ll have
plenty of chances to show he’s not guilty if he ain’t,”
the sheriff answered, not unamiably.</p>

<p>The owner of the Circle J P spoke to Black. “Saddle
old Baldy for me. I’ll ride down to Wild Horse with
you. Reckon I’ll have to go on yore bond. No use
us gettin’ annoyed. Election ain’t so fur away now.
Frank has got to make a showing. We hadn’t ought to
grudge him some grandstandin’.”</p>

<p>Daniels smiled. “That’s the way to look at it, Jake.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>CAPTAIN THURSTON K. HOLLISTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> squealed with delight and clapped her hands
when Betty told her of the approaching drive to Elk
Creek.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody, goody! An’ we’ll take Prince ’n’ Baby
Fifi ’n’ Rover. They’ll enjoy the ride too.”</p>

<p>With a smile that took the sting out of her refusal,
Betty vetoed this wholesale transportation of puppies.
“There isn’t room, dear.”</p>

<p>The child’s face registered disappointment. “I could
take ’em on my lap,” she proposed.</p>

<p>Betty reflected a moment, then decided briskly.
“We’ll take one to-day, and the others next time.”</p>

<p>“Umpha!” Ruth nodded approbation vigorously,
all animation again. “I’ll ’splain it to ’em so’s they
won’t have their feelin’s hurted.”</p>

<p>The blue eyes of the little girl inspected judicially the
small creatures whose tilted heads and wagging tails
appealed to her. To decide which one to take was a
matter of grave consideration. Their mistress wanted to
do exact justice. She changed her mind several times,
but voted at last for Baby Fifi.</p>

<p>“She’s the teentiest, ’n’ o’ course the baby must go,”
she told the other two.</p>

<p>They accepted without protest the verdict of the
super-goddess who was mistress of their destinies. Apparently
they took the occasion as seriously as she did.</p>

<p>“’N’ the delicatest,” she went on. “But if you’re
good, ’n’ bee-have, ’n’ everyfing, Mamma’ll bring you
somefing awful nice. So you be the goodest children.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Thus it chanced that Baby Fifi, a clean blue ribbon
tied round her neck in honor of the event, looked out
from the tonneau of the car upon a panorama of blue
sky and bluer mountain and sunbathed foothill moving
past in a glory of splendor satisfying to both eye and
soul.</p>

<p>They drove to the lower mouth of the cañon. A man
with pick and shovel was clearing rocks and débris
away from what was evidently to be the line of the
ditch. Reed guessed that he was really posted at this
point as a sentinel to guard against another possible
attack.</p>

<p>The boss of the gang, the man said, was doing some
surveying from the top of the wall above the rim of the
gorge. A steep and rough road led to the upper mesa.</p>

<p>“Don’t know as you can make it with your car,” the
man with the pick added. “It’s a mighty stiff grade
when you get past the dugway, ’most all a team can do
to get up.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go far as we can,” Reed answered.</p>

<p>He had to go into low long before they reached the
dugway. Just beyond it was a stretch of road so precipitous
that the car balked. The cowman became
convinced that the machine could go no farther.</p>

<p>“Have to walk the rest of the way,” he said.</p>

<p>Betty looked at her little sister dubiously. “It’ll be a
hard climb for those little legs, and she’s too heavy to
carry far. We’d better leave her in the car.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we had,” assented her father, and added, in
a low voice: “If she’ll stay alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruthie doesn’t mind that. Do you, dearest, a
big girl like you? You’ll have Baby Fifi, and we’ll not
be gone half an hour.”</p>

<p>Ruth accepted her sister’s judgment without demur.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
She would rather play with Baby Fifi than tire herself
climbing the long hill.</p>

<p>“Stay right in the car, dear. Daddy and Betty won’t
be long,” the young woman said, waving a hand as she
started.</p>

<p>Betty breasted the slope with the light, free step of a
mountaineer. Though slender, she was far from frail.
Tested muscles moved with perfect coördination beneath
the smooth satiny skin.</p>

<p>At sight of her an eye leveled behind a surveyor’s
transit became instantly alive. The man caught his
breath and watched eagerly. In her grace was something
fawnlike, a suggestion of sylvan innocence and
naïveté. Was it the quality of which this was an expression
that distinguished her from a score of other nice
girls he knew? Did she still retain from the childhood
of the race a primal simplicity the others had lost by
reason of their environment? What was it Wordsworth
had written?—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“... trailing clouds of glory do we come</div>
<div class="indent3">From God, who is our home.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The glory still haloed her dusky head. It glowed in her
warm eyes and sparkled in her smile.</p>

<p>He strode through the kinnikinnick to meet them.</p>

<p>As they approached, Betty was conscious of a sharp
stab of joy. This clean-cut, light-footed man was not
the shuffling, slouchy tramp she had first met two
months earlier. The skin had taken on the bronzed hue
of health. The eyes were no longer dull and heavy, but
quick with life. The unpleasant, bitter expression had
gone from the good-looking face.</p>

<p>Betty knew what had transformed him. He had
found again the self-reliance of which he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
robbed. There burned in him once more a bright light
of manhood strong and unwavering.</p>

<p>He shook hands with Clint Reed so frankly that she
knew he cherished no grudge. There flashed into her
mind the hesitant prophecy she had once made, that
he might look back on that first day on the Diamond
Bar K as a red-letter one. It had come true. Then he
had reached the turning of the ways and had been led
into the long hard uphill climb toward self-respect.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you,” he said as his fingers met firmly
those of the girl. “You’ve come to see how Mr. Merrick
is getting along with the project, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“We heard about the trouble here and came to find
out the facts first-hand,” Reed answered.</p>

<p>The engineer told what he knew. One of his assistants
standing near was drawn into the conversation. The
cattleman asked him questions. Betty and the man
who called himself Tug Jones found themselves momentarily
alone.</p>

<p>“Fortunate I was here when you came,” the young
man said. “Another man is taking charge. Mr. Merrick
is putting me somewhere else. I don’t know where, but
I report for duty at once.”</p>

<p>Betty took from her handbag a clipping from a newspaper.
She had written the date of publication on the
headlines. It was about nine months before that time.</p>

<p>She handed the slip of paper to him.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of Captain Thurston K. Hollister?”
the girl asked, on a note of tremulousness.</p>

<p>He looked during what seemed a long silence at the picture
of the officer in uniform and the caption beneath it.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“I found it covering our pantry shelf, where it had
been ever since spring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“And you’ve brought it to me because you think
I’m Hollister?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” she said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know quite what you mean. Why are you
glad?”</p>

<p>“From that first day I knew you were—somebody.
Can’t I be glad to learn I was right?”</p>

<p>He read the clipping, and as his eyes moved down the
column there came over his face a touch of the sardonic
bitterness she knew of old.</p>

<p>“I deserve a cross, don’t I?”</p>

<p>“Two of them!” she cried impetuously.</p>

<p>He looked into her ardent, generous eyes. “Oh, half
a dozen,” he mocked.</p>

<p>But she noticed the mordant flash was gone. What
she did not know was that her faith had exorcised it.</p>

<p>“Two,” the girl insisted, an underlying flush of color
in the dark cheeks. “One for this.” She touched the
paper he was holding.</p>

<p>“And the other?” he asked, not yet caught up with
her leaping thought.</p>

<p>A qualm of fear shook her courage. Ought she to
speak of it? Was she one of those who “rush in”? It
was his personal business, and he had a right to resent any
mention of it by her. But the desire was strong in her to
say just a word and then close the subject for always.</p>

<p>“For that braver thing you’ve been doing every day
since I saw you last,” she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>He, too, flushed beneath the tan of the cheeks. Their
eyes held fast an instant.</p>

<p>When he spoke, it was to say with studied lightness,
“You and your father didn’t walk up, did you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Betty was relieved. It is an embarrassing thing to
talk with a man about those hidden things of his life
that are important to him. She felt almost as though she
had escaped from some peril.</p>

<p>“No, the car’s on the road halfway up the hill. We
couldn’t make it. Ruth’s waiting for us there,” she
answered, hurrying to follow the lead he had given.
“She has her favorite little puppy in the car with her.
We thought the climb up might be a little too much for
her.”</p>

<p>Hollister walked back with them to the car. He
talked with her father about the outrage that had
resulted in the death of poor Coyle. Betty walked
beside the men, saying nothing. She was acutely conscious
of the presence of the sunburnt young fellow
beside her. His rags had given place to a serviceable
khaki that modeled itself to the clean lines of his figure.
He walked firmly and lightly, with character. It was
observable that he had shaved not many hours since.
There was a faint line of golden hair along the cheekbone
at the place where the stroke of the razor had
terminated. He was not wearing a hat. The girl liked
the way his copper-red hair crisped in short curls over
his forehead.</p>

<p>“Jake Prowers, that’s who,” her father was saying.
“He’ll maybe hide behind Black. That’s the way the
old wolf does business.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look like a wolf.” This from Hollister.</p>

<p>“No. More like a sheep. But don’t let that fool
you. He’s the most dangerous man in this county.
Jake pulled this off to serve notice that it wasn’t safe
to work here in the cañon. Might have been a dozen
men killed. A lot he cares for that. You’ll find his
tracks are covered, too. He won’t show at all, an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
there won’t be evidence enough to convict Black or
anybody else.”</p>

<p>Betty heard with her surface mind what they were
saying, but the undercurrent of it was considering something
else. Was Hollister offended at her? Had he
meant to rebuff her for presumption? There had been a
certain rigor in his inscrutable face when he had turned
the conversation. Already she was castigating herself
for officiousness. Did he think her bold, unmaidenly?
Well, he had a right to think it. Whatever had possessed
her to say what she had? She had meant well, of
course, but that can be said of half the fools of the world
in their folly.</p>

<p>Baby Fifi came prancing up the road to meet them
with ineffective puppy barks of welcome.</p>

<p>Betty picked up the small dog and questioned it.
“Did Ruth send you to meet us? And did you both
have a good time while we were away?”</p>

<p>The child was not in the car. Betty smiled at her
father. Both of them knew the ways of Mistress
Ruth. Presently she would pounce on them from behind
that rock just above the road with piping shrieks of
glee.</p>

<p>“Where can she be, Dad?” Betty asked, in a voice
intended to carry.</p>

<p>“I wonder. You don’t suppose—”</p>

<p>Clint did not finish his sentence. His gaze had
fastened on a cigarette stub lying on the running-board
of the car. It had not been there when they left. He was
sure of that.</p>

<p>“Some one’s been here,” he said quickly.</p>

<p>Betty caught the note of tenseness in his voice. Her
eyes followed his to the bit of cigarette. She was not
frightened. There was nothing to be afraid of. Nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
in these hills would hurt Ruth. None the less, her
heart action quickened.</p>

<p>“Ruth!” she called.</p>

<p>There came no answer.</p>

<p>Clint called, sharply, imperatively. “Come out,
Ruth! No nonsense!”</p>

<p>The child did not appear. Hollister clambered up and
looked back of the big rock. She was not there. They
searched the hillside, shouting as they did so.</p>

<p>Ruth was not to be found. The echo of their alarmed
voices was the only answer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>A CLASH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> behind the cover of a huge boulder on the steep
hillside a man watched a car labor up the grade and
give up. He trained field-glasses on the occupants.
From his throat there came a sound like the snarl of a
wild animal. He had recognized the driver and the girl
in the tonneau.</p>

<p>Out of a hip pocket he drew an automatic revolver.
His teeth bared like the fangs of a wolf. Not once did
his eyes lift from the driver and the young woman with
him until they disappeared round a bend in the road
above.</p>

<p>He rose and stretched his cramped limbs, then moved
cautiously down the hill slope to the car. A child was in
the back seat playing with a puppy.</p>

<p>“Mamma’s gotta go to town an’ buy Baby Fifi some
shoes wif silver buckles ’n’ a new blue dress ’n’ free pair
of stockings. ’N’ while she’s gone, you better bee-have
or Mamma’ll have to spank you good when she gets
back,” the little girl advised.</p>

<p>At the sound of footsteps she looked up.</p>

<p>The gay make-believe fled her face. Surrounded by
love though she had always been, some instinct told her
that this man represented for her the opposite of it.
She felt a sudden imperative desire to call to her father.</p>

<p>“Wot’s yer name?” the man asked.</p>

<p>“Ruth Reed.”</p>

<p>“That Clint Reed yer dad?”</p>

<p>She told him he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>The man’s teeth showed like fangs. “Wot luck!
We’re pals, him an’ me. I’ll take yer along with old
Cig.”</p>

<p>“I don’ wantta go. I want my daddy,” Ruth announced
promptly.</p>

<p>His grin widened. It was an evil thing to see.</p>

<p>“He’ll want you, too, a while before he gets yer,” he
jeered.</p>

<p>He opened the door of the tonneau and stood on the
running-board. “Come here, kid,” he ordered.</p>

<p>Ruth shrank back to the farther side of the car. “You
go ’way. I’ll call my daddy.”</p>

<p>He caught her by the frock and dragged her forward.
“Cut out that stuff, missie. When Cig says to step
lively, why, you get a hop on yer. See?”</p>

<p>She began to scream. He clapped a dirty hand over
the child’s mouth and turned to climb the mountainside
with her in his arms.</p>

<p>Ruth kicked fiercely, impelled by terror. His right
arm tightened on the struggling legs. The tramp
climbed fast. He had to get over the summit before
Reed came back or he would be in trouble.</p>

<p>At an altitude of a mile and a half the breath comes
short when a strain is put on the lungs and heart. Cig
panted as he struggled up the rock-strewn slope. The
weight in his arms dragged him down. More than once
he slipped on the dry grass and just recovered himself
without stumbling. Before he reached the divide, he
was hot and exhausted.</p>

<p>But he dared not stop to rest. Once, near the crest, he
turned for an instant to make sure he had not been seen.
His eyes swept the road anxiously. Nobody was in
sight.</p>

<p>Ruth twisted her mouth free and began to shriek.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
He clamped his hand over her lips again with an oath.
It was all he could do to stagger with her over the rocky
brow.</p>

<p>Here, for the moment, he was safe. With the sleeve of
his coat he wiped the perspiration out of his eyes and
from his face.</p>

<p>A saddled horse was tied to a stunted pine not far
away. He dragged the child to it, mounted, and hauled
her up in front of him. A moment, and the hoofs of the
cowpony rang out as they struck the stony rubble.</p>

<p>Cig had never been on a horse till recently. It could
not be claimed that he really knew how to ride now.
But he could stick on if the animal was gentle. The
ways of the West were not his ways. He could not walk
out a mile from the cabin where he was staying and not
get lost, unless he followed familiar trails. For he was up
in the high lands of the Rockies, in a district broken
with ravines of twisted pines and jutting rock outcroppings.
Each hill and draw and gorge looked to him
just like its neighbor.</p>

<p>Cig rode into a small cañon the entrance of which
was well concealed by a growth of young quaking asps.
Through these he pushed to a cabin on the edge of the
grove.</p>

<p>He dropped the child to the ground and swung down.</p>

<p>“You take me back to my daddy,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“Nix on that stuff. Old Cig’s gonna keep yer right
here with him. I’ll learn Clint Reed how safe it is to
beat me up like his men done.”</p>

<p>“I wantta go to my daddy. You take me to my
daddy,” the child wailed.</p>

<p>The hobo picked up a switch lying on the ground.
“Youse stop whinin’. Hear me? I’ll not have it!” he
snarled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>His manner was so threatening that the sobs stuck in
her throat. She shivered with dread, while she tried to
fight back the expression of it.</p>

<p>“I—I want my sister Betty an’ my daddy,” she
whimpered.</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” he ordered from a corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>Ruth flung herself to the ground and gave way to a
passionate outbreak of grief and terror. The violence of
her emotion shook the small body of the little girl.</p>

<p>Cig took a step toward her, switch in hand. He
stopped. A sound had reached him. Something was
moving in the quaking asps.</p>

<p>Two men emerged along the winding trail. They were
on horseback. The one riding in front was Jake Prowers,
the other Don Black.</p>

<p>The tramp waved a hand at them. “Woilcome to our
city,” he called, grinning toward them. “An’ look
who’s here.”</p>

<p>Prowers pulled up. “What the jumpin’ Jehosaphat!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I got lonesome, so I brought back comp’ny for
myself,” explained Cig. It was plain that he was proud
of himself.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get her?” asked Black.</p>

<p>“Down above Elk Creek?”</p>

<p>“Was she lost?”</p>

<p>“Lost!” The tramp snickered. “Not so you could
notice it none. She was sittin’ in a car waitin’ for Clint
Reed an’ that high-heeled goil of his to come back.”</p>

<p>“But—what’s she doing here?” inquired Black,
still in the dark.</p>

<p>“Why, I brought her.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>Cig sneered contempt. “Ain’t you got any brains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
under that big lid you wear? I brought her because
she’s Clint Reed’s kid, an’ I ain’t squared my account
with him. See?”</p>

<p>Any one watching closely would have seen a change
in Black’s eyes. Something hard and steely passed into
them. “What you aimin’ to do with her?” he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t made up my mind. Mebbe I never will give
her back. Mebbe I’ll stick that bird Reed for a ransom.
No can tell.”</p>

<p>“So?” Black swung from the saddle and lounged
forward in the bandy-legged, high-heeled fashion of the
range rider. “I’ll do a li’l guessin’ my own self. Mebbe
I’ll take her right back to Clint p.d.q.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the crook narrowed. “Say, where d’youse
get that stuff, fellow? When was youse elected
king o’ Prooshia?”</p>

<p>“What kind of an outfit do you figure this is?” the
range rider asked. “Think we’re makin’ war on kids,
do you? Well, we’re not.”</p>

<p>“Who asked youse to butt in on my business?” Cig
crouched, snarling, a menace and a threat. “That ain’t
supposed to be safe for black-headed guys, I’ll tell the
world.”</p>

<p>“Not yore business any more’n mine. We’re in this
together. I’ll tell you right now you can’t pull a play
like that an’ get away with it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I?” The New Yorker’s lip curled in a sneer.
“Says <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“Says <i>I</i>.” Black’s steady gaze did not waver a
thousandth part of an inch.</p>

<p>Cig spoke to Prowers, jerking the thumb of his left
hand toward the cowpuncher. “What’s eatin’ this
black bird? He claims to be sore at this Reed guy, same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
as we are. He ain’t above stampedin’ cattle onto
sleepin’ men and croakin’ ’em. Mebbe he’s yellow an’
gettin’ ready to rap to the bulls. Mebbe—”</p>

<p>The quid of tobacco stood out in Black’s cheek like a
marble. His jaws had stopped moving. He, too, addressed
the old cattleman.</p>

<p>“Call off this wolf of yore’s, Jake, onless you want him
sent to Kingdom Come. Nobody can tell me I’m yellow
without a come-back,” he said in a low, even voice.</p>

<p>Prowers had been watching them both, curious,
vigilant, small intent eyes sweeping from one to the
other as the quarrel progressed. Now he spoke, curtly,
first to the homesteader, then to the crook.</p>

<p>“Don’t pull yore picket pin, Don. That’ll be enough,
Cig. I don’t need any demonstration.”</p>

<p>Black did not for an instant relax his rigid wariness.
“Tha’s what I’m waitin’ to find out, Jake. He said I
was yellow an’ gettin’ ready to squeal.”</p>

<p>“Back water, you,” the ranchman ordered Cig.</p>

<p>Cig hesitated, still defiant. “I ain’t lookin’ for no
trouble—”</p>

<p>“So, of course, you’ll tell Don there’s nothin’ to
what you said, that you was a li’l’ het up under the
collar.”</p>

<p>“—but I ain’t duckin’ it either. I’m willing to eat
what I said, but he can’t dictate about the kid. See?”</p>

<p>The cattleman’s light eyes stabbed bleakly at the
man. “You ain’t playin’ a lone hand, Cig. Don’s right
about it. We’re all in this. An’ another thing. Don’t
you forget for a minute that you’ll do as I say, you an’
Don both.”</p>

<p>Black looked at his employer with a kind of fierce
resentment. He had followed this man a good many
years, not to his own good. There had been times when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
he had been close to a break with him, but Prowers held
for him a sinister attraction. He never had liked him,
yet could not escape his influence.</p>

<p>“What about the kid? I’m standin’ pat on that,
Jake,” he said sullenly.</p>

<p>The old cattleman reflected. By nature he had in
him a vein secretive and malignant. The thought of
striking at Clint Reed through his little girl was not
repellent to him. But he had lived fifty years in the
West and knew its standards. The thing that Cig had
done, unless it were promptly repudiated by him,
would make Paradise Valley and the adjoining mountains
buzz like a hornets’ nest. His allies would fall
away from him instantly.</p>

<p>“You’ll take the kid back home to Clint, Don,”
Prowers said. “You’ll tell him we sent her back soon as
we found she had been taken. An’ that’s all you’ll tell
him. No mention of Cig here. Understand?”</p>

<p>Black’s jaws began to move again regularly and
evenly. “Suits me,” he agreed. “When do I go?”</p>

<p>“Why, the sooner the quicker.”</p>

<p>The instinct of a child as to grown-ups is not always
sound, but Ruth knew which of these three was her
friend. She had run to Black and caught him by the
coat, screening herself behind him. His hand rested on
the soft flaxen hair gently. Don was a bad <i>hombre</i>, a
hard, tough citizen. But something tugged at his heart
now. He knew that if it had been necessary bullets
would have stabbed the air to save the little girl who
had put herself under his protection.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget, Don. Turn her over to Clint with my
compliments. An’ you brought her home soon as we
found her. No explanations. Let him take it or leave
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>Black nodded. “I getcha. It’ll be thataway.”</p>

<p>After he had swung to the saddle he lifted the child to
the back of the horse. She was still sobbing.</p>

<p>“Don’cha, honey,” he soothed. “I’m takin’ you
right home to yore paw. That bad man ain’t ’a’ gonna
hurt you none.”</p>

<p>He rode out of the cañon and across the hills. Nobody
knew this country better than Black. All his life he had
ridden it. Following the path of least resistance, he
deflected many times from the airline that led to the
Diamond Bar K; but none could have traveled a
shorter distance to reach it.</p>

<p>Within the hour he was jogging down into Paradise
Valley.</p>

<p>A cloud of dust in the distance caught his eye. It was
moving swiftly along a road toward him.</p>

<p>“Some folks in a powerful hurry,” he murmured
aloud, and guessed at once the reason for their haste.</p>

<p>His fingers closed for an instant on the butt of a
revolver to make sure there would be no hitch in the
draw in case of need.</p>

<p>As the riders drew near, he held up the palm of his
hand to stop them. He counted eight. Clint Reed and
Lon Forbes were in the lead. Betty was among the
others.</p>

<p>“I reckon I got here what you want, Clint,” Black
said evenly.</p>

<p>He lowered Ruth from the saddle and she ran to her
father. Clint swung down and caught her into his arms
with a sound in his throat that was like a dry sob. He
murmured broken endearments while he fondled her.</p>

<p>“Oh, daddy, my daddy!” Ruth wailed.</p>

<p>Betty swung from the saddle and ran to them. Clint
passed the child to her. They clung together, Betty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
crooning little love words of happiness. “Ruthie—Ruthie—darling—precious!”</p>

<p>Between hugs and kisses Ruth explained. “A bad
man tooked me ’way ’way off on a horse ’n’ we rode ’n’
we rode. ’Nen anuvver man comed ’n’ said he’d bring
me home, ’n’ he did bring me, the nice man did.”</p>

<p>Reed strode across the road to the man who had
brought back his child. “I’ll hear your story, Black,”
he said sternly.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon I’ve got any story to tell, Clint—none
in particular. She was lost. I found her an’
brought her back. Ain’t that enough?”</p>

<p>“No. Where did you find her? Who took her?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doing on that witness-stand stuff,” the
other answered. “Jake Prowers an’ me was lookin’ for
strays up on Elk Creek when we found her. Jake told
me to tell you here she was with his compliments.
That’s all I know.”</p>

<p>“You and Jake found her?”</p>

<p>“Yessir. Didn’t I tell you that twict?”</p>

<p>“Was she alone?”</p>

<p>“There was a guy with her, but I didn’t know him.
He lit out.”</p>

<p>“What kind of lookin’ fellow?”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t see him right close.” The quid of
tobacco stuck out in the homesteader’s cheek. He
watched Reed closely, jaws motionless.</p>

<p>“You’re not a good liar, Black. You know a lot more
than you’re telling,” the owner of the Diamond Bar K
accused. “I’m gonna have it out of you, man, if I have
to tear it from your throat.”</p>

<p>Black’s figure stiffened. “Try any funny business
with me, an’ I’ll show you where to head in at, Clint,”
he said quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Why don’t you ask the kid?” Forbes said in an
aside to his employer. “Black didn’t steal her. A blind
man could see that.”</p>

<p>“He knows who did.”</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ he’s hell-bent not to tell. You won’t get
it outa him. I know Don.”</p>

<p>“It’s some of Jake Prowers’s work.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it, Clint.” The foreman turned to
Ruth. “Who was it took you outa the automobile,
honey?”</p>

<p>“A man. He was gonna whip me wiv a great big
stick, like he said Daddy did him.”</p>

<p>“What? Whip you, like—” Lon stopped to wrestle
with and overthrow a thought. “Why, dog-gone my
hide, it’s that tramp Daniels has been lookin’ for.”</p>

<p>Clint fired questions at Black like shots out of a
machine gun. “Was he a small man? Lean? Town
clothes? Talk outa the corner of his mouth? A rat-faced
fellow? Fingers cigarette-stained?”</p>

<p>Black shook his head. “You’ve sure enough got me
there, Clint. I only seen him at a distance, but seemed
like he was a big husky guy. Yes, I’m ’most sure he was.
Big as the side of a barn.”</p>

<p>“Did he seem big to you, Ruthie?” Lon asked
gently.</p>

<p>“Umpha!” She nodded her head vigorously. “He was
a nawful man, ’n’ he said he’d whip me like Daddy
did him.”</p>

<p>“Talk like this, honey?” Lon drew down a corner of
his mouth and spoke out of it. “‘De king o’ Prooshia on
de job.’”</p>

<p>Her curls danced violently up and down with acquiescence.</p>

<p>The foreman turned to Reed. “He’s sure enough the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
same bird. Where’s he been keepin’ himself at, you
reckon?”</p>

<p>“Jake Prowers could tell us that,” his employer
replied grimly.</p>

<p>This suggested another question to Forbes. “Listen,
honey Ruth. This here bad man—did him an’ Black
here act kinda like they was friends?”</p>

<p>“They had a fuss,” she said.</p>

<p>“What about?” her father asked.</p>

<p>“’Bout me. The bad man said I wasn’t comin’
home to Daddy, ’n’ he said I was too. They had a
nawful fuss.”</p>

<p>“The bad man an’ Black here?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “’N’ he tooked me on his horse ’n’
broughted me.”</p>

<p>Forbes drew aside his friend and spoke low. “Looks
like he’s got it on you, Clint. Here’s about the size of
it, the way I figure it. This scalawag Cig’s hidin’ out
in the hills. Jake Prowers is likely lookin’ after him.
Well, he steals Ruth, an’ Don here bumps into him
whilst he’s makin’ his getaway. They have a rumpus,
an’ Don brings her home. He acted pretty near like a
white man, seems to me. ’Course, he ain’t gonna give
away this tramp if he’s one of Prowers’s push. That
wouldn’t be hardly reasonable to expect.”</p>

<p>“No, I reckon not,” admitted Reed.</p>

<p>“You got no kick at Black. Hadn’t been for him
I’ll bet Ruth wouldn’t ’a’ been here a-tall. Point is,
that with him there Jake and this Cig couldn’t put over
any shenanigan.”</p>

<p>The owner of the Diamond Bar K stepped across to
the homesteader. “Take it all back, Don. I’m mightily
obliged to you for bringing my li’l’ girl home. If I ever
get a chance—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>Black interrupted. “Oh, that’s all right. What do
you take me for, anyhow? I ain’t any Apache. Why
wouldn’t I bring a kid home when I find her lost? You
birds make me tired.”</p>

<p>He nodded brusquely, wheeled his horse, and rode
away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>IRREFUTABLE LOGIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Merrick</span> sat at a table in the log cabin that served him
as field headquarters. A cheap lamp pinned down one
corner of the map in front of him, a jar of tobacco the
opposite one. Tug Hollister looked over his shoulder.
He was here to get instructions for his new assignment.</p>

<p>Piñon knots crackled cheerfully in the fireplace, emphasizing
the comfort within the cabin as compared with
the weather outside. It was raining heavily and had
been for forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>“Here’s where the engineers of the Reclamation
Service ran their lines,” Merrick said, following with the
point of a pencil a crooked course from Sweetwater Dam
to the upper mouth of Elk Creek Cañon. “They made a
mistake, probably because they were short of time. It
was clear that the water from the dam had to get down
to the Flat Tops by way of Elk Creek if at all. As soon
as they learned that the upper entrance to the cañon
is higher than the site of the dam by eighty feet they
admitted the project would not do. All the reports
are based on that. Water won’t flow uphill. Therefore
no feasible connecting canal could be built.”</p>

<p>Hollister walked round and took the chair at the other
side of the table. “Irrefutable logic,” he said.</p>

<p>“Absolutely. But I wasn’t sure of the facts upon
which it was based.”</p>

<p>“You mean you weren’t sure the canal had to run
to the upper mouth of the cañon.”</p>

<p>The chief of construction looked at his assistant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
quickly. This young fellow had more than once surprised
Merrick by the clearness of his deductions.</p>

<p>“Exactly that. So I proceeded to find out for myself.”</p>

<p>“And you learned that you could carry it over the
hills and down the draw where Prowers stampeded the
cattle.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” demanded Merrick.</p>

<p>“More irrefutable logic.” Hollister tilted back his
chair and smiled. “There’s only one break in the walls
of the cañon in the whole five miles. That’s at the draw
near the lower mouth. Since the ditch must get into the
foothills from the gorge and can’t reach them any other
way, and since it can’t enter the cañon at the upper end
on account of the law of gravity, I’m driven to the alternative—and
that’s the draw.”</p>

<p>“You use your brains,” admitted the older man
dryly. “Of course, you’re right. We’re going down the
draw.”</p>

<p>“Then the survey you had me make of the upper part
of the cañon was camouflage.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” A smile of grim amusement broke the lines of
his firm mouth. “Black’s homestead claim doesn’t
reach as far down as the draw. Prowers thought it would
be enough to close the upper mouth of the gorge to us.
So we don’t touch his land at all—don’t come within
miles of it in point of fact. To make sure Prowers won’t
jump in later, I’ve had a dummy file on the draw.”</p>

<p>Hollister looked at his chief with admiration. The
man had all the qualities that make for success—technical
skill, audacity, confidence in himself, steadiness,
force, restrained imagination, and a certain capacity for
indomitable perseverance. He would go a long way, in
spite of the fact that he was not quite the ideal leader, or
perhaps because of the lack of the fire that inspires subordinates.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
For he was not one to let a generous enthusiasm
sweep him from the moorings of common sense.</p>

<p>“You’ve made the canal survey to the draw?” the
younger man asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. A hogback below Jake’s Fork bars the way.”</p>

<p>“You’re going round it?”</p>

<p>“Can’t. Through it. You’re to begin running the
tunnel to-morrow.”</p>

<p>They discussed plans, details, equipment necessary to
attack the hogback.</p>

<p>Hollister moved camp next day in a pelting rain and
set up his tents on the soggy hillside close to the ridge.
For a week the rain kept up almost steadily. The whole
country was sloshing with moisture. During a visit to the
main camp for a consultation with Merrick, he went down
to the dam and observed that a heavy flow of water was
pouring into the reservoir. With an ordinary winter’s
snowfall in the mountains, Sweetwater would be full to
the brim long before the spring freshets had ended.</p>

<p>Day by day the drills bored deeper into the hogback
and the tunnel grew longer. By means of a chance rider
of the hills, word reached Prowers of it. He and Don
Black, who was out on bond signed by Jake, rode over
to see what this new development meant.</p>

<p>“What do you fellows think you’re doing?” asked
the cattleman in his high, crackling voice.</p>

<p>“Mining,” answered Hollister.</p>

<p>“What for? What’s the idea?”</p>

<p>“We’re driving a tunnel.”</p>

<p>“I got eyes, young fellow. What for?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Merrick didn’t tell me what he wanted it for.
He told me to get busy. Mine not to reason why, Mr.
Prowers.”</p>

<p>“Smart, ain’t you, by jiminy by jinks?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>A foreman came up and propounded a difficulty to
Hollister. That young man walked briskly away to look
the matter over and did not return. The two riders hung
around for a time, then disappeared over the brow of a
hill.</p>

<p>“The old man’s got something to think about,” the
foreman said to Hollister, chuckling.</p>

<p>“Yes, and his thinking will bring him straight to one
conclusion; that we’re not going to run through Black’s
homestead claim. When he figures out where we <i>are</i> going,
he’ll start something.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see what he can do.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, but we didn’t foresee what he would do last
time. He killed poor Coyle, and he didn’t leave enough
evidence to prove in a law court that he did it.”</p>

<p>“He’d ought to be behind the bars right now—him
an’ that Black too,” the foreman said bitterly.</p>

<p>“But they’re not—and they won’t be. That’s his
reputation, to do all sorts of deviltry and get away with
it. That’s why men won’t cross him, why they’re so
afraid of him. He’s got no scruples and he’s as cunning
as the devil.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard he’s a tough nut, too. He don’t look it,
with them skim-milk eyes of his and that little squeaky
voice.”</p>

<p>“No. Size him up beside Merrick, say, and he doesn’t
look effective,” admitted Hollister. “But he’s one of
these quiet sure killers, according to the stories they tell.
Not a fighting man, unless he’s got his back to the wall.
You’ve heard of dry-gulching. It means shooting an enemy
from ambush when he doesn’t know you’re within
fifty miles. That’s Prowers’s style. He gives me a
creepy feeling.”</p>

<p>“Here, too. You know that fool cackling laugh of his.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Well, the other day when he was pulling off the ha-ha I
got a look from him that jolted me. Lord, it dried my
blood up. I’d hate to meet him in one o’ them dry
gulches if he had any reason for wantin’ me outa the
way.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Hollister came back to business. “Believe
I’d increase the size of the shots, Tom. We’re in pretty
hard rock right now.”</p>

<p>They were running the tunnel at the narrowest point
of the hogback, which rose at a sharp angle. The snows
began before it was more than half finished. Not willing
to risk being cut off from supplies, Hollister had enough
staples hauled in to last him till he would be through.
What needs might come up unexpectedly could be met
by packers coming in over the drifts from the dam.</p>

<p>Still Prowers had not shown his hand. Hollister began
to think him less dangerous than he had supposed.
The big bore grew longer every day. In a few weeks it
would be finished. Surely the cattleman would not wait
to strike until after the job was done.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>A STERN CHASE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> clean bracing air of the Rockies, together with hard
work and plenty of it, had poured new life into the blood
of Tug Hollister. The ashen, pasty look had been replaced
on his face by a coat of healthy brown. The
fierce, driving headaches had gone, but there were still
hours when the craving for the drug possessed him and
sent him tramping through the night to fight the depression
that swept in waves through his heart.</p>

<p>Winter settled over the hills. The wind roared along
the slope of the divide and drove before it great scudding
clouds heavily laden with moisture. Storms fought and
screamed around the peaks. Snow fell day after day. It
packed in the gulches and drifted into the draws. The
landscape became a vast snowfield across which the bitter
winds drove and flung themselves at the flapping
tents.</p>

<p>There came, too, nights of wonderful stillness broken
only by the crackling of branches in the cold, nights
when the stars were out in myriads and the white valley
was a vast open-air cathedral built and decorated by the
Master Hand.</p>

<p>On such a night Hollister turned in and slept till the
small hours. He woke, to find himself restless and irritable,
the craving for the drug strong on him. His chance
of further sleep was gone.</p>

<p>Without lighting a lantern, he pulled on his heavy
wool socks, his o.d. breeches, and his fourteen-inch Chippewa
pattern boots. His groping fingers found a leather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
vest with corduroy sleeves. Outside, he fastened on his
skis.</p>

<p>During the night the weather had changed. It had
come on to snow. The flakes were large and few, but experience
told the engineer that soon they would be coming
thick enough. He put on a slicker before he started
on his tramp.</p>

<p>Uncertain which way to go, he stood for a moment
outside the flap of the tent. The rim of the saucer-shaped
valley lay straight ahead. Beyond were the
great white snow wastes, stretching mile on mile, isolating
the little camp more effectually than a quarantine.
He decided to climb out of the draw and push across the
hilltops.</p>

<p>To his ears came a faint slithering sound. He listened,
heard it again. The crunching of a ski on crusted snow!
Who could be out at this time of night? Why? For what
purpose?</p>

<p>It was probably one of the men, he reflected. But
none of them would be on skis to move over the beaten
paths around the camp. Some sixth sense warned of
danger in the vicinity. He crept around the tent in the
direction from which the sound had come. His glance
took in the other tents, scarcely visible against the background
of white in the dim light of pre-dawn. Everything
there was still and silent.</p>

<p>Again there came to him the hiss of a ski. A hundred
yards distant was the mouth of the tunnel. A moving
figure stood out, black against the pale background.
Some one who had obviously just emerged from the
tunnel was shuffling away through the snow.</p>

<p>Hollister did not shout an order to halt. Instinctively
he knew that something was wrong, and already he was
bending to his stride. Before he had taken half a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
steps the head of the other man swung round hurriedly.
Instantly the unknown quickened his pace.</p>

<p>Before they had traveled a hundred yards, Hollister
knew he was more expert in the use of the runners than
the fugitive. Barring accidents he would catch him.</p>

<p>The pursued man made for the rim of the valley.
From time to time he turned without stopping to see
whether he was losing ground. The distance between
the two was lessening. Hollister knew it. Evidently the
other knew it, too, for he tried desperately to increase
his pace.</p>

<p>The hundred yards had become seventy-five, fifty,
twenty-five. They were out of the valley now, swinging
toward the left where a patch of timber lay back of a
clump of quaking asps. A pile of boulders were huddled
beneath a rock-rim a stone’s throw to the right.</p>

<p>The snow was falling more heavily now. It was plain
that the fugitive was hoping to reach the timber and escape
in the thickening storm. To prevent this, Hollister
worked farther to the left. He came up quickly with the
other and passed him fifteen yards or less away.</p>

<p>A gun cracked. Hollister’s long stride did not slacken.
He was keeping well away because he had known the
other would be armed. The engineer had made a serious
mistake in not stopping to get his revolver.</p>

<p>Again the revolver sounded. The bullet flew harmlessly
past. Tug had circled ahead of his prey and cut
him off from the grove of quaking asps. He was relying
on a piece of audacity to protect him from the armed man.
The stranger would assume that he, too, was armed.</p>

<p>Evidently this was the man’s reasoning. He swung to
the right, making for the refuge of the rocks. Presently
he glanced back to see if he was followed and how closely.
The end of the ski must have caught under a rock beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
the snow, for the man was flung forward to his
face. The binder of a ski had broken. He rose quickly,
caught up the long snowshoe, and ran forward at a gait
between a hobble and a shuffle.</p>

<p>Tug did not pursue directly. He had no desire to stop
any of the bullets left in the chambers of the revolver.
Instead of taking the trail made for him, he broke a new
one that led to the summit of the rock-rim above the
boulder bed. There was a chance that in doing this he
might lose his man, but it was a chance that had to be
taken. His guess was that the refugee would find a hiding-place
in the rocks and would stay there long enough,
at any rate, to mend the broken strings of the ski.</p>

<p>From the rock-rim Hollister looked down upon the
boulder bed through the thick snow. He made out a
crouched figure below. Satisfied that his victim was not
still traveling, he examined the terrain to work out a plan
of campaign. A heavy snow comb yawned above the
rock-rim. This might very well serve his purpose. Using
one of his skis as a lever, he loosened the heavy pack
of snow. It moved at first very slowly, but went at last
with a rush. There was a roar as it plunged over the
bluff and tore a way down to the rocks below. The slide
gathered momentum as it went.</p>

<p>Hollister peered down. The crouched figure was gone,
had been buried in the giant billow of white.</p>

<p>The engineer refastened his ski, took a few swinging
strokes forward, and came to a smooth incline. Down
this he coasted rapidly.</p>

<p>The buried man was just struggling out of the white
mass when a hand closed on his coat collar. It dragged
him from the pack and held him firmly down. Not till
Tug made sure that the revolver was missing did he let
the man rise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Wot’ell’s eatin’ youse?” the rescued man growled,
snarling at him.</p>

<p>Tug Hollister stood face to face with the tramp he
knew by the name of Cig. Recognition was simultaneous.</p>

<p>“What were you doing at my camp?”</p>

<p>“Aw, go chase yoreself. I ain’t been near your
camp.”</p>

<p>“All right, if that’s your story. We’ll go back there
now. The sheriff wants you.”</p>

<p>The evil face of the crook worked. Out of the corner
of his twisted mouth he spoke venomously. “Say, if I
had my gun I’d croak youse.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t it. Get busy. Dig out your skis.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doing. Dig ’em yoreself if youse want ’em.”</p>

<p>Hollister knew of only one argument that would be effective
with this product of New York’s underworld. He
used it, filled with disgust because circumstances forced
his hand. When Cig could endure no longer, he gave
way sullenly.</p>

<p>“’Nuff. But some day I’ll get you right for this. I
aimed to bump you off, anyhow. Now I soitainly will.
I ain’t forgot you rapped on me to that guy Reed.”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you once I didn’t, and you wouldn’t
believe me. We’ll let it go at that. Now get those
skis.”</p>

<p>The snowshoes were rescued and the broken one
mended. Hollister watched his prisoner every minute of
the time. He did not intend to run the risk of being hit
in the head by a bit of broken rock.</p>

<p>The two moved down into the valley, Cig breaking
trail. He made excuses that he was dead tired and
couldn’t go another step. They did not serve him well.
His captor would not let the crook get in his rear for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
single second. He knew that, if the fellow got a chance,
he would murder him without the least hesitation.</p>

<p>In a blinding snowstorm the two men reached camp.
Twice Cig had tried to bolt and twice had been caught
and punished. This was a degrading business, but the
engineer had no choice. It was necessary to bring the
man in because he had been up to some deviltry, and
Hollister could not let him go without first finding out
what it was.</p>

<p>He took him into his own tent and put him through a
searching quiz. The result of it was precisely nothing.
Cig jeered at him defiantly. If he could prove anything
against him, let him go to it. That was the substance of
the New Yorker’s answers.</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll turn you over to Clint Reed. He’s got
something to say to you for stealing his little girl. From
the way he talked, I judge you’re in for a bad time of
it.”</p>

<p>Cig protested. He hadn’t stolen the girl. How did
they know he had? Who said so? What would he do a
crazy thing like that for? To all of which Hollister said
calmly that he would have to explain that to Reed. If
he could satisfy the cattleman, it would be all right with
him. Reed could pass him on to Sheriff Daniels without
further delay.</p>

<p>“You’re a heluva pardner, ain’t youse?” sneered the
crook with an ugly lift of his upper lip. “T’row me
down foist chance youse get.”</p>

<p>“I’m not your partner. We hit different trails the
day we left the Diamond Bar K ranch. You needn’t
play baby on me. That won’t buy you anything.”</p>

<p>“Gonna turn me over to Reed, then, are youse?”</p>

<p>“I’ve no time to bother with you. He’ll know how to
handle the case. Better that way, I reckon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Cig said nothing. For half an hour there was silence
in the tent. Hollister knew that his threat was sinking
in, that the kidnapper was uneasily examining the situation
to find the best way out.</p>

<p>Daylight came, and with it signs of activity around
the camp. Smoke poured out of the stovepipe projecting
from the chuck tent. Men’s voices sounded. At last
the beating of an iron on the triangle summoned them
to breakfast.</p>

<p>“We’ll eat before we start,” Hollister said.</p>

<p>“Don’ want nothin’ to eat,” growled the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Different here. I do. You’ll come along, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The men at breakfast looked with surprise at the
guest of the boss when he appeared. Hollister explained
what he was doing there.</p>

<p>“I want to go into the tunnel and have a look around
before any of you do any work,” he added. “This fellow
was up to some mischief, and I want to find out what it
was.”</p>

<p>Cig’s palate went dry. He knew better than they did
in what a predicament he had put himself. If he let the
thing go through as originally intended, these men
would never let him reach a sheriff. If he confessed—what
would they do to him?</p>

<p>He ate mechanically and yet voraciously, for the exercise
of the night had left him hungry. But every moment
his mind was sifting the facts of the case for an out.</p>

<p>Hollister rose to leave. “Take care of this fellow till I
get back, Tom. I don’t know what he was up to, but if
anything happens to me, rush him right down to Daniels.”</p>

<p>“We will—in a pig’s eye,” the foreman answered
bluntly. “If anything happens to you, we’ll give this
bird his, muy pronto.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>The engineer was lifting the flap of the tent when Cig
spoke huskily from a parched throat. “I’ll go along wid
youse.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Not the least change of expression in his
face showed that Hollister knew he had won, knew he
had broken down the fellow’s stiff and sullen resistance.</p>

<p>Cig shuffled beside Tug to the tunnel. The months
had made a difference in the bearing of the ex-service
man. When the New Yorker had met him first, Hollister’s
mental attitude found expression in the way he
walked. He was a tramp, in clothes, in spirit, in habit of
life, and in the way he carried his body. The shoulders
drooped, the feet dragged, the expression of the face
was cynical. Since then there had been relit in him the
spark of self-respect. He was a new man.</p>

<p>He stepped aside, to let Cig pass first into the tunnel.
At the entrance he lit two candles and handed one to his
prisoner.</p>

<p>“What did you want to come for?” he asked. “Have
you something to show me? Or something to tell me?”</p>

<p>Cig moved forward. He spoke over his shoulder, protecting
the candle with one hand. “Just a bit of a lark.
Thought I’d throw a scare into yore men.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>The former convict continued through the tunnel to
the face of the rock wall. He set his candle down on a
niche of jutting sandstone. With his fingers he scraped
away some sand from the ragged wall.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Hollister’s voice was sharp. He held
out his hand. “Let’s have it.”</p>

<p>From beneath the sand Cig had taken a stick of dynamite.
He dug up five others.</p>

<p>The object of putting them there was plain enough.
If a workman had struck any one of them with a pick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
there would have been an explosion, and the sand beds
round the rocks were precisely the places into which the
pick points would have gone. The thing had been a deliberate
attempt at cold-blooded wholesale murder.</p>

<p>“Sure you have them all?” Hollister asked.</p>

<p>“Yep. Had only six.” He added, with a whine:
“Didn’t aim to hurt any o’ the boys, but only to scare
’em some.”</p>

<p>The engineer made no comment. He drove his prisoner
before him back into the light. Tom met him at
the entrance to the tunnel. The foreman examined the
sticks of dynamite, listened to what Hollister had to
say, and jerked his head toward Cig.</p>

<p>“The boys’ll fix him right so’s he’ll never pull
another trick like this,” he told his chief.</p>

<p>“No,” opposed Hollister. “Nothing of that sort,
Tom. I’m going to take him down to the sheriff. We’ll
send him over the road.”</p>

<p>“Like blazes we will!” the foreman burst out. “If
you hadn’t happened to see him this morning, three or
four of us might be dead by now. Hanging’s too good
for this guy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Tug. “But we’re not going to put ourselves
in the wrong because he is. The law will deal with
him.”</p>

<p>“The boys ain’t liable to feel that way,” Tom said
significantly.</p>

<p>“They won’t know anything about it till we’ve gone.
You’ll tell them then.” His hand fell on the foreman’s
shoulder with a grip that was almost affectionate. “We
can’t have a lynching here, Tom. We’d be the ones in
bad then.”</p>

<p>Tom had to feel his way through a few moments of
sulkiness to acceptance of this point of view. “All right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
You’re the doctor. Hustle this fellow outa camp an’ I’ll
wait till you’re gone. Sure he’s picked up every stick of
this stuff?”</p>

<p>Cig was quite sure about that. He spoke humbly and
with all the braggadocio gone from his manner. He had
been thoroughly frightened and did not yet feel wholly
out of the woods. Not till he was behind the bars would
he feel quite safe again.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>OUT OF THE BLIZZARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> called a warning to Hollister as the engineer and
his prisoner struck out into the blinding storm. “Careful
you don’t get lost. Looks like she’s gettin’ her back
up for a reg’lar snifter.”</p>

<p>The snow was still falling thickly, but it had behind it
now a driving wind that slapped it in the faces of the
men at a slanting angle. Presently under the lee of a hill
they got their backs to the storm, but this did not
greatly improve conditions, for the whip of the wind
caught up the surface drifts and whirled them at the
travelers.</p>

<p>Hollister had buckled on a belt with a revolver and
had taken the precaution to rope his prisoner to him
with ten feet of slack between. They ploughed through
the new snow that had fallen above the crust, making
slow progress even with the wind to help.</p>

<p>From the shelter of the gulch they came into the full
force of the howling hurricane. It caught them as they
crossed a mesa leading to a cañon. Hollister realized
that the snow was thinning, but the wind was rising and
the temperature falling. He did not like that. Even to
his lack of experience there was the feel of a blizzard in
the air. Moreover, before they were halfway across the
mesa he had a sense of having lost his direction.</p>

<p>Cig dropped back, whining. This was an adventure
wholly out of his line. He was game enough in his way,
but bucking blizzards was not one of the things he had
known in his city-cramped experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“We gotta go back. It’ll get us sure if we don’t,” he
pleaded.</p>

<p>Tug would have turned back gladly enough if he had
known which way to go, but in the swirl of white that
enveloped them he did not know east from west. The
thing to do, he judged, was to strike as straight a line as
possible. This ought to take them off the mesa to the
shelter of some draw or wooded ravine.</p>

<p>“It’ll be better when we get where the wind can’t
slam across the open at us,” he said.</p>

<p>For the moment at least the former convict was
innocuous. He was wholly preoccupied with the battle
against the storm. Tug took the lead and broke
trail.</p>

<p>The whirling snow stung his face like burning sand.
His skis clogged with the weight of the drifts. Each
dragging step gave him the sense of lifting a leaden ball
chained to his feet.</p>

<p>Cig went down, whimpering. “I’m all in!” he shrieked
through the noise of the screaming blasts.</p>

<p>“Forget it, man!” Hollister dragged him to his feet.
“If you quit now you’re done for. Keep coming. We’ll
get off this mesa soon. It can’t be far now.”</p>

<p>He was none too confident himself. Stories came to
his mind of men who had wandered round and round in
a circle till the blizzard had taken toll of their vitality
and claimed them for its own.</p>

<p>The prisoner sank down again and had to be dragged
out of the drift into which he had fallen. Five or six
times the taut rope stopped Tug’s progress. Somehow
he cheered and bullied the worn-out man to the edge of
the mesa, down a sharp slope, and into the wind-break
of a young grove of pines.</p>

<p>Into the snow Cig dropped helplessly. The hinges of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
his knees wouldn’t hold him any longer. His expression
reminded Hollister of the frightened face of a child.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ west,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not this trip,” the engineer told him. “Buck up
and we’ll make it fine. Don’t know this country, do
you? We’re at the mouth of a gulch.”</p>

<p>Cig looked around. In front of him was a twisted pine
that looked like an umbrella blown inside out. He recognized
it.</p>

<p>“This gulch leads into another. There’s a cabin in
it,” he said. “A heluva long ways from here.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better get started,” Tug suggested.
“The cabin won’t come to us.”</p>

<p>He gave the Bowery tough a hand to help him to his
feet. Cig pulled himself up.</p>

<p>“Never get there in the world,” he complained. “Tell
you I’m done.”</p>

<p>He staggered into the drifts after his leader. The bitter
wind and cold searched through their clothing to
freeze the life out of them. At the end of a long slow two
hundred yards, the weaker man quit.</p>

<p>Hollister came back to him. He lay huddled on the
newly broken trail.</p>

<p>“Get up!” ordered Tug.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doing. I’m through. Go on an’ leave me if
youse want to, you big stiff.”</p>

<p>It was the man’s last flare of defiance. He collapsed
into himself, helpless as a boxer counted out in the roped
ring. Hollister tugged at him, cuffed him, scolded, and
encouraged. None of these seemed even to reach his
consciousness. He lay inert, even the will to live beaten
out of him.</p>

<p>In that moment, while Hollister stood there considering,
buffeted by the howling wind and the sting of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
pelting sleet, he saw at his feet a brother whose life must
be saved and not an outlaw and potential murderer. He
could not leave Cig, even to save himself.</p>

<p>Tug’s teeth fastened to one end of a mitten. He
dragged it from his hand. Half-frozen fingers searched in
his pocket for a knife and found it. They could not open
the blade, and he did this, too, with his teeth. Then,
dropping to one knee awkwardly, he sawed at the thongs
which fastened the other’s skis. They were coated with
ice, but he managed to sever them.</p>

<p>He picked up the supine body and ploughed forward
up the gulch. The hope he nursed was a cold and forlorn
one. He did not know the cañon or how far it was to the
gulch in which the cabin was. By mistake he might go
wandering up a draw which led nowhere. Or he might
drop in his tracks from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>But he was a fighter. It was not in him to give up.
He had to stagger on, to crawl forward, to drag his burden
after him when he could not carry it. His teeth
were set fast, clinched with the primal instinct to go
through with it as long as he could edge an inch toward
his goal.</p>

<p>A gulch opened out of the cañon. Into it he turned,
head down against a wind that hit him like a wall. The
air, thick with sifted ice, intensely cold, sapped the
warmth and vitality of his body. His numbed legs
doubled under the weight of him as though hinged. He
was down and up again and down, but the call of life
still drove him. Automatically he clung to his helpless
load as though it were a part of himself.</p>

<p>Out of the furious gray flurry a cabin detached itself.
He weaved a crooked path toward it, reached the wall,
crept along the logs to a door. Against this he plunged
forward, reaching for the latch blindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>The door gave, and he pitched to the floor.</p>

<p>He lay there, conscious, but with scarcely energy
enough of mind or body to register impressions. A fire
roared up the chimney. He knew that. Some one rose
with an exclamation of amazement at his intrusion.
There was a hiatus of time. His companion of the adventure,
still tied to him, lay on the floor. A man was
stooping over Cig, busy with the removal of his ice-coated
garments.</p>

<p>The man cut the rope. Hollister crawled closer to the
fire. He unfastened the slicker and flung it aside. If he
had not lost his knife, he would have cut the thongs of
the skis. Instead, he thrust his feet close to the red glow
to thaw out the ice-knots that had gathered.</p>

<p>He was exhausted from the fight through the deep
drifts, but he was not physically in a bad way. A few
hours’ sleep would be all he needed to set him right.</p>

<p>“Take a nip of this,” a squeaky voice advised.</p>

<p>Hollister turned his head quickly. He looked into the
leathery face and skim-milk eyes of Jake Prowers. It
would be hard to say which of them was the more
startled.</p>

<p>“By jiminy by jinks, if it ain’t the smart-aleck hobo
engineer,” the cattleman announced to himself.</p>

<p>“Is he alive?” asked Tug, nodding toward the man on
the floor.</p>

<p>“Be all right in a li’l’ while. His eyes flickered when
I gave him a drink. How’d you come here, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Got lost in the storm. He played out. Had to drag
him.” Tug rubbed his hands together to restore circulation.</p>

<p>“Mean you got lost an’ just happened in here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Hmp! Better be born lucky than with brains, I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
say. What were you doin’ out in the blizzard? Where
you headed for?”</p>

<p>“I was taking him to Wild Horse—to the sheriff.”</p>

<p>A mask dropped over the eyes of the little cattleman.
“What for? What’s he been doin’?”</p>

<p>“He’s wanted for shooting Mr. Reed and firing his
wheatfield.”</p>

<p>“You been appointed deputy sheriff since you took
to playin’ good?”</p>

<p>“And for other things,” the engineer added, as though
Prowers’s sneer had not been uttered.</p>

<p>“Meanin’ which?”</p>

<p>“Kidnapping Reed’s little girl.”</p>

<p>“No proof of that a-tall. Anything more?”</p>

<p>The eyes of the two met and grew chill. Hollister
knew that the rancher was feeling out the ground. He
wanted to find out what had taken place to-day.</p>

<p>“What more could there be?” Tug asked quietly.</p>

<p>Neither relaxed the rigor of his gaze. In the light-blue
orbs of the older was an expression cold and cruel,
almost unhuman, indefinably menacing.</p>

<p>“Claims I was tryin’ to blow up his mine.” The voice
came from behind Prowers. It was faint and querulous.
“Say, I’m froze up inside. Gimme a drink, Jake.”</p>

<p>Prowers passed the bottle over. He continued to look
at the uninvited guest who knew too much. “Howcome
you to get that notion about him blowin’ up yore
tunnel?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Caught him at it. Dragged him back and made him
show where he had put the sticks of powder,” Hollister
answered grimly. “You interested in this, Mr.
Prowers?”</p>

<p>“Some. Why not? Got to be neighborly, haven’t
I?” The high voice had fallen to a soft purr. It came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
to Hollister, with a cold swift patter of mice feet down
his spine, that he was in deadly danger. Nobody knew
he was here, except these two men. Cig had only to
give it out that they had become separated in the blizzard.
They could, unless he was able to protect himself,
murder him and dispose of the body in entire safety.
If reports were true, Prowers was an adept at that kind
of sinister business. Tug had, of course, a revolver, but
he knew that the cattleman could beat him to the draw
whenever he chose. The old man was a famous shot.
He would take his time. He would make sure before he
struck. The blow would fall when his victim’s wariness
relaxed, at the moment when he was least expecting it.</p>

<p>Tug knew that neither of these two in the room with
him had any regard for the sanctity of human life.
There are such people, a few among many millions,
essentially feral, untouched by any sense of common
kinship in the human race. Prowers would be moved by
one consideration only. Would it pay to obliterate him?
The greatest factor in the strength of the cattleman’s
position was that men regarded him with fear and awe.
The disappearance of Hollister would stir up whisperings
and suspicions. Others would read the obvious lesson.
Daunted, they would sidestep the old man rather
than oppose him. Yet no proof could be found to establish
definitely a crime, or at any rate to connect him with it.</p>

<p>The issue of the Sweetwater Dam project meant more
to Prowers than dollars and cents. His power and influence
in the neighborhood were at stake, and it was
for these that he lived. If the irrigation project should
be successful, it would bring about a change in the
character of the country. Settlers would pour in, farm
the Flat Tops, and gobble up the remnants of the open
range. To the new phase of cattle-raising that must develop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
he was unalterably opposed. He had no intention,
if he could prevent it, of seeing Paradise Valley
dominated by other men and other ways. The development
of the land would make Clint Reed bulk larger
in the county; it would inevitably push Jake into the
background and make of him a minor figure.</p>

<p>To prevent this, Prowers would stick at nothing.
Hollister was only a subordinate, but his death would
serve excellently to point a sinister moral. If more
important persons did not take warning, they, too,
might vanish from the paths of the living.</p>

<p>“You’re neighborly enough, even if you visited us
by deputy this morning,” Hollister answered, level gaze
fixed on the cattleman.</p>

<p>“Did I visit you by deputy?” Jake asked, gently
ironical.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you? One with six sticks of dynamite to
help us on the job.”</p>

<p>“News to me. How about it, Cig? What’s yore
smart-aleck friend drivin’ at?”</p>

<p>Cig had crept forward to the fire and lay crouched on
the hearth. His twitching face registered the torture
of a circulation beginning to normalize itself again in
frozen hands and feet.</p>

<p>“Said he’d turn me over to that guy Reed. Took
advantage of me while I was played out to beat me up,”
snarled the city tough. He finished with a string of
vile epithets.</p>

<p>The splenetic laughter of the cattleman cackled out.
“So you’re aimin’ to take Cig here down to Daniels
with that cock-an’-bull story you cooked up. Is that the
play?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going to take him down—now or later.”</p>

<p>This appeared to amuse the little man. His cracked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
laughter sounded again. “Now or later, by jimmy by
jinks. My hobo friend, if you’d lived in this country
long as I have, you wouldn’t gamble heavy on that
‘later.’ If you’d read yore Bible proper, you’d know
that man’s days are as grass, which withers up considerable
an’ sudden. Things happen in this world of
woe right onexpected.”</p>

<p>Tug did not dodge this covert threat. He dragged it
into the open. “What could happen to me now we’re
safe out of the storm, Mr. Prowers?”</p>

<p>The skim-milk eyes did not change expression, but
there seemed to lie back of them the jeer of mockery.
“Why, ’most anything. We eat canned tomatoes for
supper, say—an’ you get lead poisonin’. I’ve known
real healthy-lookin’ folks fall asleep an’ never wake up.”</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s true,” Hollister agreed, an odd sinking
in the pit of his stomach. “And I’ve seen murderers
who could have passed a first-class life insurance examination
quit living very suddenly. The other day I
read a piece about a scoundrel in Mexico who had killed
two or three people. He rather had the habit. When he
shot another in the back, his neighbors rode to his
ranch one night and hanged him to his own wagon
tongue.”</p>

<p>“I always did say Mexico was no place for a white
man to live,” the old fellow piped amiably. “Well, I
expect you boys are hungry, buckin’ this blizzard.
What say to some dinner?”</p>

<p>“Good enough. No canned tomatoes, though, if you
please.”</p>

<p>Once more Hollister and Prowers measured eyes before
the cattleman grinned evilly.</p>

<p>“Glad you mentioned it. I was aimin’ to have tomatoes,”
he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>“COME ON, YOU DAMN BUSHWHACKER”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fury of the storm rattled the window panes. Down
the chimney came the shrill whistle of the gale. The
light of day broke dimly through the heavy clouds that
swept above the gulch from peak to peak.</p>

<p>Two of the men sitting at dinner in the cabin
watched each other intently if covertly. The third,
dog-tired, nodded over the food he rushed voraciously
to his mouth.</p>

<p>“Gonna pound my ear,” Cig announced as soon as he
had finished eating.</p>

<p>He threw himself on a bunk and inside of five minutes
was snoring.</p>

<p>Tug, too, wanted to sleep. The desire of it grew
on him with the passing hours. Overtaxed nature demanded
a chance to recuperate. Instead, the young
man drank strong coffee.</p>

<p>Jake Prowers’s shrill little voice asked mildly, with
the hint of a cackle in it, if he was not tired.</p>

<p>“In the middle of the day?” answered Tug, stifling a
yawn.</p>

<p>“Glad you ain’t. You ’n’ me’ll be comp’ny for each
other. Storm’s peterin’ out, looks like.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the guest.</p>

<p>It was. Except for occasional gusts, the wind had
died away. Tug considered the possibility of leaving
before night fell. But if he left, where could he go in the
gathering darkness? Would Prowers let him walk safely
away? Or would a declaration of his intention to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
bring an immediate showdown? Even so, better fight
the thing out now, while he was awake and Cig asleep,
than wait until he slipped into drowsiness that would
give the little spider-man his chance to strike and kill.</p>

<p>Tug had no longer any doubt of his host’s intention.
Under a thin disguise he saw the horrible purpose riding
every word and look. It would be soon now. Why not
choose his own time and try to get the break of the draw?</p>

<p>He could not do it. Neither will nor muscles would
respond to the logical conviction of his mind that he was
entitled to any advantage he could get. To whip out his
gun and fire might be fair. He had no trouble in deciding
that it was. But if luck were with him—if he
came out alive from the duel—how could he explain
why he had shot down without warning the man who was
sheltering him from the blizzard? For that matter, how
could he justify it to himself in the years to come? A
moral certainty was not enough. He must wait until
he <i>knew</i>, until the old killer made that lightning move
which would give him just the vantage-ground Tug was
denying himself.</p>

<p>All that Tug could do was watch him, every nerve
keyed and muscle tensed, or bring the struggle to immediate
issue. He came, suddenly, clearly, to the end of
doubt.</p>

<p>“Time I was going,” he said, and his voice rang clear.</p>

<p>“Going where?” Prowers’s hand stopped caressing
his unshaven chin and fell, almost too casually, to his
side.</p>

<p>They glared at each other, tense, crouched, eyes narrowed
and unwinking. Duels are fought and lost in that
preliminary battle of locked eyes which precedes the
short, sharp stabbings of the cartridge explosions. Soul
searches soul for the temper of the foe’s courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Neither gaze wavered. Each found the other stark,
indomitable. The odds were heavily in favor of the old
cattleman. He was a practiced gunman. Quicker than
the eye could follow would come the upsweep of his arm.
He could fire from the hip without taking aim. Nobody
in the county could empty a revolver faster than he.
But the younger man had one advantage. He had disarranged
Prowers’s plans by taking the initiative, by
forcing the killer’s hand. This was unexpected. It
disturbed Jake the least in the world. His opponents
usually dodged a crisis that would lead to conflict.</p>

<p>A cold blast beat into the house. In the open doorway
stood a man, the range rider Black. Both men
stared at him silently. Each knew that his coming had
changed the conditions of the equation.</p>

<p>Under the blue cheek of the newcomer a quid of tobacco
stood out. It was impossible to tell from his
impassive face how much or how little of the situation
he guessed.</p>

<p>“Ran outa smokin’,” he said. “Thought I’d drap
over an’ have you loan me the makin’s.”</p>

<p>He had closed the door. Now he shuffled forward to
the fire and with a charred stick knocked the snow from
his webs.</p>

<p>“A sure enough rip-snorter, if any one asks you,”
he continued mildly by way of comment on the weather.
“Don’t know as I recall any storm wuss while it lasted.
I seen longer ones, unless this ’un ’s jest gatherin’
second wind.”</p>

<p>Tug drew a deep breath of relief and eased down.
Red tragedy had been hovering in the gathering shadows
of the room. It was there no longer. The blessed
homely commonplace of life had entered with the lank
homesteader and his need of “the makin’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Not fur from my place,” Black went on, ignoring
the silence. “But I’ll be dawg-goned if it wasn’t ’most
all I could do to break through the drifts. If I’d ’a’
known it was so bad I’m blamed if I wouldn’t ’a’
stayed right by my own fireside an’ read that book my
sister give me twenty-odd years ago. Its a right good
book, I been told, an’ I been waitin’ till I broke my
laig to read it. Funny about that, too. The only time
I ever bust my laig an’ got stove up proper was ’way
down on Wild Cat Creek. The doc kep’ me flat on a
bunk three weeks, an’ that book ‘David Coppermine’
a whole day away from me up in the hills.”</p>

<p>“David Copperfield,” suggested Tug.</p>

<p>“Tha’s right, too. But it sure fooled me when I
looked into it onct. It ain’t got a thing to do with the
Butte mines or the Arizona ones neither. Say, Jake,
what about that tobacco? Can you lend me the loan
of a sack?”</p>

<p>Prowers pointed to a shelf above the table. He was
annoyed at Black. It was like his shiftlessness not to
keep enough tobacco on hand. Of all the hours in the
year, why should he butt in at precisely this one? He
was confoundedly in the way. The cattleman knew that
he could not go on with this thing now. Don was not
thoroughgoing enough. He would do a good many
things outside the law, but they had to conform to his
own peculiar code. He had joined in the cattle stampede
only after being persuaded that nobody would be
hurt by it. Since then Jake had not felt that he was
dependable. The homesteader was suffering from an
attack of conscience.</p>

<p>Cig had wakened when the rush of cold air from the
open door had swept across the room. He sat up now,
yawning and stretching himself awake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“What a Gawd-forsaken country!” he jeered. “Me
for de bright lights of li’l’ ol’ New York. If Cig ever
lands in de Grand Central, he’ll stick right on de island,
b’lieve me. I wisht I was at Mike’s Place right dis
minute. A skoit hangs out dere who’s stuck on yours
truly. Some dame, I’ll tell de world.” And he launched
into a disreputable reminiscence.</p>

<p>Nobody echoed his laughter. Hollister was disgusted.
Black did not like the tramp. The brain of Prowers was
already spinning a cobweb of plots.</p>

<p>Cig looked round. What was the matter with these
boobs, anyhow? Didn’t they know a good story when
they heard one?</p>

<p>“Say, wot’ell is dis—a Salvation Army dump before
de music opens up?” he asked, with an insulting lift of
the upper lip.</p>

<p>Tug strapped on his skis, always with an eye on
Prowers.</p>

<p>Which reminded Cig. A triumphant venom surged
up in him.</p>

<p>“Gonna take me down to de cop, are youse?” he
sneered. “Say, will youse ring for a taxi, Jake? I
gotta go to jail wid dis bird.”</p>

<p>In two sentences Prowers gave his version of the
story to Black. Tug corrected him instantly.</p>

<p>“He came to blow us up in the tunnel. When I took
him back, he dug six sticks of dynamite out of the dirt in
the rock wall.”</p>

<p>Black spat into the fire. His face reflected disgust,
but he said nothing. What was there to say, except that
his soul was sick of the evil into which he was being
dragged by the man he accepted as leader?</p>

<p>Tug put on his slicker.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” asked Black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“To the camp.”</p>

<p>“’S a long way. Better stay at my shack to-night.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged. I will.”</p>

<p>They went out together. Tug was careful to walk
with Black between him and the cabin as long as it was
in sight.</p>

<p>The wind had died completely, so that the air was no
longer a white smother. Travel was easy, for the cold
had crusted the top of the snow. They worked their
way out of the gulch, crossed an edge of the forest
reserve, and passed the cabin of the homesteader
Howard. Not far from this, Black turned into his own
place.</p>

<p>The range rider kicked off his webs and replenished
the fire. While he made supper, Hollister sat on the
floor before the glowing piñon knots and dried his skis.
When they were thoroughly dry, he waxed them well,
rubbing in the wax with a cork.</p>

<p>“Come an’ get it,” Black called presently.</p>

<p>They sat down to a meal of ham, potatoes, biscuits,
plenty of gravy, and coffee. Tug did himself well. He
had worked hard enough in the drifts to justify a man-size
hunger.</p>

<p>Their talk rambled in the casual fashion of haphazard
conversation. It touched on Jake Prowers and
Cig, rather sketchily, for Black did not care to discuss
the men with whom he was still allied, no matter what
his private opinion of them might be. It included the
tunnel and the chances of success of the Sweetwater
Dam project, this last a matter upon which they differed.
Don had spent his life in the saddle. He stuck
doggedly to the contention that, since water will not
run uphill, the whole enterprise was “dawg-goned foolishness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Hollister gave up, shrugging his shoulders. “All right
with me. A man convinced against his will, you know.
Trouble with you is that you don’t want the Flat Tops
irrigated, so you won’t let yourself believe they can be.”</p>

<p>“The Government engineers said they couldn’t be
watered, didn’t they? Well, their say-so goes with me
all right.”</p>

<p>“They were wrong, but you needn’t believe it till you
see water in the ditches on Flat Top.”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>Tug rose from the table and expanded his lungs in a
deep, luxurious yawn. “Think I’ll turn in and sleep
round the clock if you don’t mind. I can hardly keep
my eyes open.”</p>

<p>Black waved his hand at the nearest bunk. “Go to
it.”</p>

<p>While he was taking off his boots, the engineer came
to a matter he wanted to get off his mind. “Expect you
know the hole I was in when you showed up this afternoon.
I’ll say I never was more glad to see anybody in
my life.”</p>

<p>“What d’you mean?” asked Black, blank wall eyes
full on his guest.</p>

<p>“I mean that Prowers was watching for a chance to
kill me. I’d called for a showdown a moment before you
opened the door.”</p>

<p>The range rider lied, loyally. “Nothin’ to that a-tall.
What would Jake want to do that for? Would it get
him anything if he did? You sure fooled yoreself if
that’s what you were thinking.”</p>

<p>“Did I?” The eyes of the younger man were on
Black, hard, keen, and intent. “Well, that’s exactly
what I was thinking. And still am. Subject number two
on which we’ll have to agree to disagree.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“Jake’s no bad man runnin’ around gunnin’ men for
to see ’em kick. You been readin’ too much Billy the
Kid stuff, I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p>Tug dropped the second boot on the floor and rose to
take off his coat.</p>

<p>There came the sound of a shot, the crash of breaking
glass. Hollister swayed drunkenly on his feet, groped
for the back of a chair, half turned, and slid to the floor
beside the bunk.</p>

<p>Usually Black’s movements were slow. Now no
panther could have leaped for the lamp more swiftly.
He blew out the light, crept along the log wall to the
window, reached out a hand cautiously, and drew a curtain
across the pane through which a bullet had just
come. Then, crouching, he ran across the room and
took a rifle from the deer’s horns upon which it rested.</p>

<p>“Come on, you damn bushwhacker. I’m ready for
you,” he muttered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> was whipping mayonnaise in the kitchen when a
voice hailed the Diamond Bar K ranch in general.</p>

<p>“Hello the house!”</p>

<p>Through the window she saw a rider on a horse, and a
moment later her brain localized him as a neighborhood
boy who had recently joined the forest rangers. She
went to the door, sleeves still rolled back to the elbows
of the firm satiny arms.</p>

<p>“Hoo-hoo!” she called, flinging a small hand wildly
above her head in greeting. “Hoo-hoo, Billy boy!”</p>

<p>He turned, caught sight of her, and at once began to
smile. It was noticeable that when Betty laughed, as
she frequently did for no good reason at all except a
general state of well-being, others were likely to join in
her happiness.</p>

<p>“Oh, there you are,” he said, and at once descended.</p>

<p>“Umpha! Here I am, but I won’t be long. I’m
making salad dressing. Come in to the kitchen if you
like. I’ll give you a cookie. Just out o’ the oven.”</p>

<p>“Listens good to Billy,” he said, and stayed not on
the order of his coming.</p>

<p>She found him a plate of cookies and a stool. “Sit
there. And tell me what’s new in the hills. Did you
pass the dam as you came down? And what d’you
know about the tunnel?”</p>

<p>The ranger stopped a cookie halfway to his mouth.
“Say, that fellow—the one drivin’ the tunnel—he’s
been shot.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Last night—at Don Black’s cabin.”</p>

<p>A cold hand laid itself on her heart and stopped its
beating. “You mean—on purpose?”</p>

<p>He nodded. “Shot through the window at dark.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hollister—that who you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yep. That’s what he calls himself now. Jones it
was at first.”</p>

<p>“Is he—hurt badly?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so. In the side—internal injuries. Outa
his head when I was there this mo’ning.”</p>

<p>“What does the doctor say?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t seen him yet. On the way up now. I
’phoned down from Meagher’s ranch. He’d ought to
pass here soon.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t they get the doctor sooner? What
were they thinking about?” she cried.</p>

<p>“Nobody with him but Don Black. He couldn’t
leave him alone, he claims. Lucky I dropped in when I
did.”</p>

<p>Impulsively Betty made up her mind. “I’m going to
him. You’ll have to take me, Billy.”</p>

<p>“You!” exclaimed the ranger. “What’s the big
idea, Betty?”</p>

<p>“Dad’s gone to Denver to the stock show. I’m
going to look after him. That’s what Dad would want
if he were here. Some one’s got to nurse him. What
other woman can go in on snowshoes and do it?”</p>

<p>“Does he have to have a woman nurse? Can’t Mr.
Merrick send a man up there to look after him?”</p>

<p>“Don’t argue, Billy boy,” she told him. “You see
how it is. They don’t even get a doctor to him for
fifteen or sixteen hours. By this time he may be—”
She stopped and bit her lip to check a sudden swell of
emotion that choked up her throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Bridget came into the kitchen. Betty’s announcement
was both a decision and an appeal. “Mr. Hollister’s
been hurt—shot—up in the hills. I’m going
up to Justin to make him take me to him.”</p>

<p>“Is he hur-rt bad?” asked the buxom housekeeper.</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t know. Billy thinks so. If I hurry I
can get there before night.”</p>

<p>Bridget hesitated. “I was thinkin’ it might be better
for me to go, dearie. You know how folks talk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, talk!” Betty was explosively impatient. She
always was when anybody interfered with one of her
enthusiasms. “Of course, if you could go. But you’d
never get in through the snow. And what could they
say—except that I went to save a man’s life if I
could?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Merrick might not like it.”</p>

<p>“Of course he’d like it.” The girl was nobly indignant
for her fiancé. “Why wouldn’t he like it? It’s just
what he’d want me to do.” Under the brown bloom of
her cheeks was the peach glow of excitement.</p>

<p>Bridget had traveled some distance on the journey of
life, and she had her own opinion about that. Merrick,
if she guessed him at all correctly, was a possessive man.
He could appreciate Betty’s valiant eagerness when it
went out to him, but he would be likely to resent her
generous giving of herself to another. He did not belong
to the type of lover that recognizes the right of a
sweetheart or a wife to express herself in her own way.
She was pledged to him. Her vocation and avocation in
life were to be his wife.</p>

<p>But Bridget was wise in her generation. She knew
that Betty was of the temperament that had to learn
from experience. She asked how they would travel to
the dam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“On horseback—if we can get through. The road’s
not broken yet probably after yesterday’s storm.
We’ll start right away. I can’t get Justin on the ’phone.
The wire must be down.”</p>

<p>The ranger saddled for her and they took the road.
Betty carried with her a small emergency kit of medical
supplies.</p>

<p>Travel back and forth had broken the road in the
valley. It was not until the riders struck the hill trail
that they had to buck drifts. It was slow, wearing work,
and, by the time they came in sight of the dam, Betty’s
watch told her that it was two o’clock.</p>

<p>Merrick saw them coming down the long white slope
and wondered what travelers had business urgent
enough to bring them through heavy drifts to the
isolated camp. As soon as he recognized Betty, he went
to meet her. Billy rode on down to the tents. He knew
when he was not needed.</p>

<p>Rich color glowed in her cheeks, excitement sparkled
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing here?” Merrick
asked.</p>

<p>She was the least bit dashed by his manner. It suggested
censure, implied that her adventure—whatever
the cause of it—was a bit of headstrong folly. Did he
think it was a girl’s place to stay at home in weather
like this? Did he think that she was unmaidenly, had
bucked miles of snowdrifts because she could not stay
away from him?</p>

<p>“Have you heard about Mr. Hollister? He’s been
hurt—shot.”</p>

<p>“Shot?”</p>

<p>“Last night. At Black’s cabin.”</p>

<p>“Who shot him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“I don’t know. He’s pretty bad, Billy says.”</p>

<p>“Doctor seen him yet?”</p>

<p>“He’s on the way now. I want you to take me to
him, Justin.”</p>

<p>“Take <i>you</i>? What for?”</p>

<p>“To nurse him.”</p>

<p>He smiled, the superior smile of one prepared to argue
away the foolish fancies of a girl.</p>

<p>“Is your father home yet?”</p>

<p>“No. He’ll be back to-morrow. Why?”</p>

<p>“Because, dear girl, you can’t go farther. In the first
place, it’s not necessary. I’ll do all that can be done for
Hollister. The trip from here won’t be a picnic.”</p>

<p>“I’ve brought my skis. I can get in all right,” she
protested eagerly.</p>

<p>“I grant that. But there’s no need for you to go.
You’d far better not. It’s not quite—” He stopped in
mid-sentence, with an expressive lift of the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Not quite proper. I didn’t expect <i>you</i> to say that,
Justin,” she reproached. “After what he did for us.”</p>

<p>“He did only what any self-respecting man would
do.”</p>

<p>Her smile coaxed him. “Well, I want to do only what
any self-respecting woman would do. Surely it’ll be all
right if you go along.”</p>

<p>How could he tell her that he knew no other unmarried
woman of her age, outside of professional nurses,
who would consider such a thing for the sake of a comparative
stranger? How could he make her see that
Black’s cabin was no place for a young girl to stay?
He was exasperated at her persistence. It offended his
<i>amour propre</i>. Why all this discussion about one of his
employees who had been a tramp only a few months
since?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Merrick shook his head. His lips smiled, but there
was no smile in his eyes. “You’re a very impulsive and
very generous young woman. But if you were a little
older you would see—”</p>

<p>She broke impatiently into his argument. “Don’t you
see how I feel, Justin? I’ve got to do what I can for him.
We’re not in a city where we can ring up for a trained
nurse. I’m the only available woman that can get in
to him. Why did I take my Red Cross training if I’m
not to help those who are sick?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you trust me to look out for him?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can. That’s not the point. There’s so
much in nursing. Any doctor will tell you so. Maybe
he needs expert care. I really can nurse. I’ve done it
all my life.”</p>

<p>“You don’t expect to nurse everybody in the county
that falls sick, do you? Don’t you see, dear girl, that
Black’s shack is no place for you?”</p>

<p>“Why isn’t it? I’m a ranchman’s daughter. It
doesn’t shock or offend me to see things that might
distress a city girl.” She cast about in her mind for
another way to put it. “I remember my mother leaving
us once for days to look after a homesteader who had
been hurt ’way up on Rabbit Ear Creek. Why, that’s
what all the women on the frontier did.”</p>

<p>“The frontier days are past,” he said. “And that’s
beside the point, anyhow. I’ll have him well looked
after. You needn’t worry about that.”</p>

<p>“But I would,” she urged. “I’d worry a lot. I want
to go myself, Justin—to make sure it’s all right and
that everything’s being done for him that can be. You
think it’s just foolishness in me, but it isn’t.”</p>

<p>She put her hand shyly on his sleeve. The gesture
was an appeal for understanding of the impulse that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
was urgent in her. If he could only sympathize with it
and acknowledge its obligation.</p>

<p>“I think it’s neither necessary nor wise. It’s my
duty, not yours, to have him nursed properly. I’ll not
shirk it.” He spoke with the finality of a dominant
man who has made up his mind.</p>

<p>Betty felt thrown back on herself. She was disappointed
in him and her feelings were hurt. Why must
he be so obtuse, so correct and formal? Why couldn’t
he see that she <i>had</i> to go? After all, a decision as to
what course she would follow lay with her and not with
him. He had no right to assume otherwise. She was
determined to go, anyhow, but she would not quarrel
with him.</p>

<p>“When are you going up to Black’s?” she asked.</p>

<p>“At once.”</p>

<p>“Do take me, please.”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “It isn’t best, dear girl.”</p>

<p>In her heart flamed smokily rebellious fires. “Then
I’ll go with Billy.”</p>

<p>He interpreted the words as a challenge. Their eyes
met in a long, steady look. Each measured the strength
of the other. It was the first time they had come into
open conflict.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that, Betty,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how I feel about it. You won’t
understand.” Her voice shook with emotion. “I’ve
<i>got</i> to go.”</p>

<p>Merrick knew that he could prevent the ranger from
guiding Betty to the gulch where the wounded man was,
but it was possible to pay too great a price for victory.
He yielded, grudgingly.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you. After you’ve seen Hollister, you can
give us directions for nursing him. I should think the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
doctor ought to know, but, if you haven’t confidence
in him, you can see to it yourself.”</p>

<p>Betty found no pleasure now in her desire to help.
Justin’s opposition had taken all the joy out of it. Nor
did his surrender give her any gratification. He had not
yielded because he appreciated the validity of her purpose,
but because he had chosen to avoid an open breach.
She felt a thousand miles away from him in spirit.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said formally, choking down a
lump in her throat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>BLACK IS SURPRISED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not in youth to be long cast down for the troubles
of a stranger, even one who has very greatly engaged
the sympathy. In spite of Betty’s anxiety about the
wounded man, her resilient spirits had sent her eagerly
upon this adventure.</p>

<p>She would see Justin. He would approve her plans
with enthusiasm. Together they would ski across the
white wastes, they two alone in a vast world of mysterious
stillness. The thin clear air of the high Rockies
would carry their resonant voices like the chimes of bells.
Silences would be significant, laughter the symbol of
happy comradeship. For the first time they would come
glowing through difficulties, perhaps dangers, conquered
side by side. And at the end of the journey waited for
them service, that which gave their joyous enterprise
the value of an obligation.</p>

<p>And it was not at all like that—not a bit as she had
day-dreamed it on the ride to Sweetwater Dam. The
joy was struck dead in her heart. Miserably she realized
that Justin could not understand. The ardent
fire that burned in her soul seemed only mushy sentiment
to him, on a par with the hysteria that made
silly women send flowers to brutal murderers they did
not know.</p>

<p>The bars were up between them. The hard look in
his eyes meant anger. There would be no expression
of it in temper. He was too self-contained for that.
None the less it was anger. The reflection of it gleamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
out from under her own dark lashes. She told herself
she hated the narrowness in him that made him hold
so rigidly to the well-ordered, the conventional thing.
Why couldn’t he see that there was an imperative on
her to <i>live</i>? Well, she would show him. Probably he
thought that in every clash of will she ought to yield.
He could learn his lesson just as well now as later.</p>

<p>She held her head high, but there was a leaden weight
in her bosom that made her want to sob.</p>

<p>Often she had been proud of his tremendous driving
power, the force that made of him a sixty-horse-power
man. She resented it fiercely to-day. He was traveling
just a little too fast for her, so that she could hardly
keep up with him. But she would have fallen in her
tracks rather than ask him to go slower.</p>

<p>Once the slither of his runners stopped. “Am I going
too fast?” he asked coldly.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she answered stubbornly.</p>

<p>He struck out again. They were climbing a long slope
that ended in a fringe of timber. At the top he waited,
watching her as she labored up heavily. The look he
gave her when she reached him said, “I told you so.”</p>

<p>Before them lay a valley, beyond which was another
crest of pines.</p>

<p>“How far now?” Betty asked, panting from the climb.</p>

<p>“Just beyond that ridge.”</p>

<p>“That all?” she said indifferently. “Thought it was
a long way.”</p>

<p>“We’ll coast into the valley,” he replied curtly.</p>

<p>She watched him gliding into the dip of the slope.
He was not an expert on runners as her father was, but
he had learned the trick of the thing pretty well. It
was in line with his thoroughness not to be a novice long
at anything he set out to master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Betty shot down after him, gathering impetus as she
went. She was watching the path ahead, and it was
not till she was close upon him that she saw Merrick had
fallen. She swerved to the left, flinging out her arms
to prevent herself from going down. Unsteadily she
teetered for a moment, but righted herself with an effort
and kept going till she reached the bottom.</p>

<p>Merrick was on his feet when she turned.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong?” she called.</p>

<p>“One of my skis broken.”</p>

<p>She went back to him. “How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“Dipped into a rock under the snow.” His voice
was sullen. Like many men who do well whatever they
undertake, he resented any mishap due to lack of his
own skill. His sense of superiority would have been
satisfied if the accident had befallen her instead of him.</p>

<p>Betty did not smile, but, nevertheless, she was maliciously
pleased. It would bring him down a peg, anyhow.</p>

<p>“What’ll you do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose I can hobble along somehow. Perhaps
I’d better take your skis and hurry on. I could borrow
a pair at the cabin and come back for you. Yes, I think
that would be better.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “No, I’ll go on and send Mr.
Black with a pair. I’d rather not wait here in the cold.
I’ll not be long. You can keep moving.”</p>

<p>This did not suit Merrick at all. He did not want to
be regarded as an incompetent who had bogged down
in the snow. It hurt his pride that Betty should go on
and send back help to him, especially when they felt
criss-cross toward each other.</p>

<p>“I’d rather you didn’t,” he said. “You don’t know
who is at the cabin. That tramp Cig may be there—or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> 
Prowers. They’re dangerous, both of them. Yesterday
they tried to blow up the men working on the tunnel.”</p>

<p>“You can lend me your revolver, then, if you like.
But I’m not afraid. Mr. Black wouldn’t let them hurt
me even if they wanted to.”</p>

<p>“It’s not very cold. I’d be back in a little while.
And, as you say, you could keep moving.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m going on,” she answered, and her quiet
voice told him she had made up her mind.</p>

<p>He unbuckled his belt and handed it to her. “You’ll
be safer with that .38,” he said. What he thought is not
of record.</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Betty’s little smile, with its hint of sarcasm,
suggested that there was not the least need of the
revolver; if she wore it, the only reason was to humor
his vanity and let him feel that he was protecting her.</p>

<p>She crossed the valley and climbed the ridge. From
the farther side of it she looked down upon a log cabin
of two rooms, a small stable, and a corral. They nestled
in a draw at her feet, so close that a man could have
thrown a stone almost to the fence. The hillside was
rough with stones. With Justin’s mishap in mind, she
felt her way down carefully.</p>

<p>Smoke poured out of the chimney and polluted the
pure light air. No need of seeing the fire inside to know
that the wood was resinous fir.</p>

<p>Betty knocked on the door.</p>

<p>It opened. Black stood on the threshold looking
down at her in ludicrous amazement. She had taken off
her coat and was carrying it. Against a background of
white she bloomed vivid as a poinsettia in her old-rose
sweater and jaunty tam. The cold crisp air had whipped
the scarlet into her lips, the pink into her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“What in—Mexico!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“How’s Mr. Hollister?”</p>

<p>“A mighty sick man. Howcome you here, miss?”</p>

<p>The sound of a querulous voice came from within.
“Tell you I don’t want the stuff. How many times I
got to say it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve come to nurse him. Billy brought us word.
Father wasn’t home—nor Lon. So Mr. Merrick
brought me.”</p>

<p>“Merrick,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“He’s over the hill, a ways back. Broke a ski. He’d
like you to take him a pair. I’ll look after Mr. Hollister.”</p>

<p>As she followed the lank range rider into the cabin,
she pulled off her gauntlets. Her cold fingers fumbled
with the ski ties.</p>

<p>“Lemme do that,” Black said, and dropped on a
knee to help.</p>

<p>“I guess you can do it quicker.” She looked at the
patient and let her voice fall as she asked a question.
“Is he delirious?”</p>

<p>“Crazy as a hydryphoby skunk.” He repeated what
he had said before. “A mighty sick man, looks like.”</p>

<p>Betty looked into the hot, fevered face of the man
tossing on the bed. From her medicine kit she took a
thermometer. His fever was high. She prepared medicine
and coaxed him to swallow it.</p>

<p>“Where is he wounded?” she asked.</p>

<p>“In the side.”</p>

<p>“Did you wash out the wound and bind it up?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m. I’ve took care of fellows shot up before.”</p>

<p>“Bleed much?”</p>

<p>“Right smart. Did you hear when Doc Rayburn
was comin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“He’s on the way.” She found cold water and bathed
the burning face.</p>

<p>“Wisht he’d hustle along,” the range rider said uneasily.</p>

<p>“He won’t be long.” With a flare of anger she turned
on Black. “Who shot him?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. He was shot through the window whilst
he was ondressin’ for bed. We come together from the
old Thorwaldson cabin a while before.”</p>

<p>“Did that Cig do it?”</p>

<p>“Might have, at that.” Black was putting on his
webs. “Reckon I’ll drift back an’ pick up yore friend
Merrick.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said absently. “It was that tramp Cig or
Jake Prowers, one.”</p>

<p>“Yore guess is as good as mine,” he said, buttoning to
the neck a leather coat.</p>

<p>“Can’t we have more light in here? It’s dark. If
you’d draw back that window curtain—”</p>

<p>“Then Mr. Bushwhacker would get a chanct for another
shot,” he said dryly. “No, I reckon we’ll leave
the curtain where it’s at.”</p>

<p>Her big startled eyes held fascinated to his. “You
don’t think they’d shoot him again now.”</p>

<p>“Mebbeso. My notion is better not give ’em a show
to get at him. You keep the door closed. I’ll not be
long. I see you got a gun.”</p>

<p>There was something significant in the way he said it.
Her heart began to beat fast.</p>

<p>“You don’t think—?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. If I did, I’d stay right here. Not a
chanct in a hundred. How far back’s yore friend?”</p>

<p>“Less than a mile.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s likely been movin’ right along. When I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
reach the ridge, I’ll give him the high sign an’ leave the
skis stickin’ up in the snow there.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” And, as he was leaving, “Don’t be long,” she
begged.</p>

<p>“Don’t you be scared, miss. Them sidewinders don’t
come out in the open an’ do their wolf-killin’. An’ I
won’t be gone but a li’l’ while. If anything worries you,
bang away with that .38 an’ I’ll come a-runnin’.”</p>

<p>He closed the door after him. From behind the curtain
she watched him begin the ascent. Then she went
back to her patient and bathed his hot hands. Betty
echoed the wish of the range rider that the doctor would
come. What could be keeping him? From the Diamond
Bar K ranch to Wild Horse was only a few miles. He
must have started before she did. It would not be long
now.</p>

<p>In spite of a two days’ growth of beard, the young
fellow on the bed looked very boyish. She gently
brushed back the curls matted on the damp forehead.
He was rambling again in desultory speech.</p>

<p>“A cup o’ cold water—cold lemonade. Happy days,
she says. No trouble friendship won’t lighten, she says,
with that game smile lighting up her face. Little thoroughbred.”</p>

<p>A warm wave of exultant emotion beat through her
blood. It reached her face in a glow of delicate beauty
that transformed her.</p>

<p>“You dear boy!” she cried softly, and her eyes were
shining stars of tender light.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>THE MAN WITH THE BLEACHED BLUE EYES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was not much she could do for him except bathe
again his face and hands. He asked for a drink, and
Betty propped him up with her arm while she held the
tin cup to his lips. Exhausted by the effort, he sank
back to the pillow and panted. All the supple strength
of his splendid youth had been drained from him. The
muscles were lax, the movements of the body feeble.</p>

<p>Sunken eyes stared at her without recognition. “Sure
I’ll take your hand, and say ‘Thank you’ too. You’re
the <i>best</i> little scout, the best ever.”</p>

<p>She took the offered hand and pressed it gently.
“Yes, but now you must rest. You’ve been sick.”</p>

<p>“A Boche got me.” His wandering subconscious
thoughts flowed into other memories. “Zero hour, boys.
Over the top and give ’em hell.” Then, without any
apparent break from one theme to another, his thick
voice fell to a cunning whisper. “There’s a joint on
South Clark Street where I can get it.”</p>

<p>Into his disjointed mutterings her name came at times,
spoken always with a respect that was almost reverence.
And perhaps a moment later his voice would ring out
clear and crisp in directions to the men working under
him. Subjects merged into each other inconsequently—long-forgotten
episodes of school days, college larks,
murmured endearments to the mother who had died
many years since. Listening to him, Betty knew that
she was hearing revelations of a soul masculine but
essentially clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>A sound startled her, the click of the latch. She
turned her head swiftly as the door opened. Fear
drenched her heart. The man on the threshold was
Prowers. He had come out of a strong white light and
at first could see nothing in the dark cabin.</p>

<p>Betty watched him as he stood there, his bleached
blue eyes blinking while they adjusted themselves to
another focus.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” she asked sharply, the accent
of alarm in her voice.</p>

<p>“A woman, by jiminy by jinks!” The surprise in his
squeaky voice was pronounced. He moved forward
to the bed. “Clint Reed’s girl. Where you come from?
How’d you get here?”</p>

<p>She had drawn back to the wall at the head of the
bed in order to keep a space between them. Her heart
was racing furiously. His cold eyes, with the knife-edge
stab in them, held hers fast.</p>

<p>“I came in over the snow to nurse him.”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“No. Mr. Merrick’s with me.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At the top of the hill. He broke a ski.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Don?”</p>

<p>“Gone to meet him. They’ll be here in a minute.”</p>

<p>A cunning, impish grin broke the lines of the man’s
leathery face. He remembered that he had come prepared
to be surprised to hear of Hollister’s wound.
“Nurse who?” he asked suavely.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hollister, the engineer driving the tunnel.”</p>

<p>“Sick, is he?” He scarcely took the trouble to veil
his rancorous malice. It rode him, voice, manner, and
mocking eye. His mouth was a thin straight line, horribly
cruel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Some one shot him—last night—through the
window.” She knew now that he had done it or had
had it done. The sense of outrage, of horror at his unhuman
callousness, drove the fear out of her bosom.
Her eyes accused him, though her tongue made no
charge.</p>

<p>“Shot him, by jiminy by jinks! Why, Daniels had
ought to put the fellow in the calaboose. Who did it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Do you?” she flashed back.</p>

<p>His evil grin derided her. “How would I know, my
dear?”</p>

<p>He drew up a chair and sat down. The girl did not
move. Rigid and watchful, she did not let her eye waver
from him for an instant.</p>

<p>He nodded toward the delirious man. “Will he make
it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Doc seen him yet?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Glad I came. I can help nurse him.” He cut short
a high cackle of laughter to ask a question. “What’s
yore gun for, dearie? You wouldn’t throw it on poor
Jake Prowers, would you?”</p>

<p>He was as deadly as dynamite, she thought, more
treacherous than a rattlesnake. She wanted to cry out
her horror at him. To see him sitting there, humped up
like a spider, not three feet from the man he had tried
to murder, filled her with repulsion. There was more in
her feeling than that; a growing paralysis of terror lest
he might reach out and in a flash complete the homicide
he had attempted.</p>

<p>She tried to reason this away. He dared not do
it, with her here as a witness, with two men drawing
closer every minute. Don Black had told her that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
wouldn’t strike in the open, and the range rider had
known him more years than she had lived. But the
doubt remained. She did not know what he would do.
Since she did not live in the same world as he, it was
not possible for her to follow his thought processes.</p>

<p>Then, with no previous intimation that his delirium
had dropped from him, the wounded man startled Betty
by asking a rational question.</p>

<p>“Did you come to see how good a job you’d done?”
he said quietly to Prowers.</p>

<p>The cowman shook his head, still with the Satanic
grin. “No job of mine, son. I’m thorough.”</p>

<p>“Your orders, but maybe not your hand,” Hollister
insisted feebly.</p>

<p>Betty moved into his line of vision, and to his startled
brain the motion of her was like sweet unearthly
music. He looked silently at her for a long moment.</p>

<p>“Am I still out of my head?” he asked. “It’s not
really you, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, very gently. “You mustn’t talk.”</p>

<p>“In Black’s cabin, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Shot through the window, Black told me. Remember,
if I don’t get well, it was this man or Cig that did it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember,” she promised. “But you’re going
to get well. Don’t talk, please.”</p>

<p>“Just one thing. What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I came to look after you. Now that’s all—please.”</p>

<p>He said no more, in words. But the eyes of sick men
are like those of children. They tell the truth. From
them is stripped the veil woven by time and the complexities
of life.</p>

<p>Sounds of voices on the hillside drifted to the cabin.
Betty’s heart leaped joyfully. Friends were at hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
It was too late now for Prowers to do any harm even
if it was in his mind.</p>

<p>The voices approached the cabin. The girl recognized
that of Merrick, strong and dominant and just a
little heavy. She heard Black’s drawling answer, without
being able to distinguish the words.</p>

<p>The door opened. Four men came into the room. The
two who brought up the rear were Dr. Rayburn and
Lon Forbes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lon!” Betty cried, and went to him with a
rush. “I’m awf’ly glad you came.”</p>

<p>She clung to him, trembling, a sob in her throat.</p>

<p>The rawboned foreman patted her shoulder with a
touch of embarrassment. “There—there, honey,
’s all right. Why didn’t you wait for old Lon instead
o’ hoppin’ away like you done?”</p>

<p>Prowers tilted back his chair on two legs and chirped
up with satiric comment. “We got quite a nice party
present. Any late arrivals not yet heard from?”</p>

<p>Both Lon and Justin Merrick were taken aback. In
the darkness they had not yet recognized the little man.</p>

<p>The foreman spoke dryly. “Might ’a’ known it.
Trouble and Jake Prowers hunt in couples. Always
did.”</p>

<p>“I could get a right good testimonial from Mr. Lon
Forbes,” the cowman said, with his high cackle of splenetic
laughter. “Good old Lon, downright an’ four-square,
always a booster for me.”</p>

<p>Betty whispered. “He’s an awful man, Lon. I’m
scared of him. I didn’t know any minute what he was
going to do. Oh, I <i>am</i> glad you came.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” Lon replied. “Don’t you be scared,
Betty. He can’t do a thing—not a thing.”</p>

<p>Merrick had been taking off his skis. He came up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Betty now. “Did he annoy you—say anything or—?”</p>

<p>“No, Justin.” A shiver ran down her spine. “He
just looked and grinned. I wanted to scream. He shot
Mr. Hollister. I know he did. Or had it done by that
Cig.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t doubt that.”</p>

<p>The doctor, disencumbered of impedimenta of snowshoes
and wraps, fussed forward to the bedside. “Well,
let’s see—let’s see what’s wrong here.”</p>

<p>He examined the wound, effervesced protests and
questions, and prepared for business with the bustling
air that characterized him.</p>

<p>“Outa the room now—all but Miss Reed and one o’
you men. Lon, you’ll do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay,” announced Merrick with decision.</p>

<p>“All right. All right. I want some clean rags, Black.
You got plenty of hot water, I see. Clear out, boys.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need a good nurse, Doc?” Prowers
asked, not without satiric malice. He was playing with
fire, and he knew it. Everybody in the room suspected
him of this crime. He felt a perverted enjoyment in
their hostility.</p>

<p>Black chose this moment to make his declaration
of independence. “I’d light a shuck outa here if I was
you, Jake, an’ I wouldn’t come back, seems to me.”</p>

<p>The cold, bleached eyes of the cowman narrowed.
“You’re givin’ me that advice <i>as a friend</i>, are you,
Don?” he asked.</p>

<p>The range rider’s jaw stopped moving. In his cheek
the tobacco quid stuck out. His face, habitually set to
the leathery imperturbability of his calling, froze now
to an expressionless mask.</p>

<p>“I’m sure givin’ you that advice,” he said evenly.</p>

<p>“I don’t hear so awful good, Don. As a friend, did you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
say?” The little man cupped an ear with one hand in
ironic mockery.</p>

<p>Black’s gaze was hard as gun-metal. “I said I’d
hit the trail for home if I was you, Jake, an’ I’d stay
there for a spell with kinda low visibility like they said
in the war.”</p>

<p>“I getcha, Don.” Prowers shot a blast of cold lightning
from under his scant brows. “I can take a hint
without waitin’ for a church to fall on me. Rats an’
a sinkin’ ship, eh? You got a notion these fellows are
liable to win out on me, an’ you want to quit while the
quittin’ is good. I been wonderin’ for quite a while
if you wasn’t yellow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that wonderin’ out loud, Jake,” the other
warned quietly. “If you do, you’ll sure enough find
out.”</p>

<p>The little man laughed scornfully, met in turn defiantly
the eyes of Betty, Merrick, and Forbes, turned
on his heel, and sauntered out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>BETTY HAS HER OWN WAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Black</span> had not himself built the cabin where he
lived. While he was still a boy jingling his first spurs,
two young Englishmen had hewn its logs out of the
untouched forest on the western slope of Pegleg Pass.
They were remittance men, exiled from their country
for the peace of mind of their families. In the casual
fashion of their class they had drifted to the Rockies
to hunt for big game and, less industriously, for elusive
fortune. Long since they had returned to the estates
which Britishers of this type seem always to be inheriting
from convenient relatives.</p>

<p>By the simple process of moving in, Black had become
owner of the cabin. He hung his pinched-in cowboy
hat on a peg in the wall and thereby took possession.
His title was perfectly good in the eyes of the range
riders who dropped in occasionally and made themselves
at home. Whether Don was or was not on the
place, they were welcome to what they found. The only
obligation on them was to cut a fresh supply of firewood
in place of that they used.</p>

<p>One room was enough for Black’s needs. The other
served as a place in which to store old saddles, mountain-lion
pelts, worn-out boots, blankets, unused furniture,
and a hundred odds and ends. With the help of the
owner, Lon Forbes set to work housecleaning. Useless
litter went flying out of doors. A vigorous broom in the
hands of Lon raised clouds of dust. In the fireplace old
papers and boxes blazed cheerfully. A Navajo rug, resurrected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
from the bottom of a hingeless trunk, covered
the floor in front of a walnut bed imported by one of the
Englishmen from Denver.</p>

<p>It took hours to make the transformation, but the
foreman was quite pleased with himself when he ushered
Betty into the bedroom he had prepared for her.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands softly. “My, Lon! What a
fine wife some Suffragette’s lost in you. Maybe it isn’t
too late yet. You can keep house while she—”</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” expostulated Forbes.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you’ve got your eye on one of these little
flapper girls, of course, there’s no use my saying a word,”
she teased. “I know how stubborn you are when you
get ‘sot.’”</p>

<p>She was in a mood of happy reaction from the fears
that had oppressed her all day. Dr. Rayburn had told
her—with some reservations, to be sure—that, barring
unexpected complications, Hollister ought to get
well. It would take time and nursing and good food,
but all of these the patient would get.</p>

<p>“You’re right I’ve got my eye on one of them li’l’
flapper girls—this very minute,” he rapped back
promptly. “An’ she’s a sure-enough warnin’ to a fellow
to play his hand out alone unless he wants to be bossed
somethin’ scandalous.”</p>

<p>“It would do you good to be bossed,” she told him,
eyes dancing. “The refining influence of a young
woman—say about forty-five or maybe fifty—”</p>

<p>“You’re pickin’ her for me, are you?” he snorted.</p>

<p>“She’ll do the picking when the time comes. I suppose
you’ll have to give up smoking—and you’ll have
to shave every day—and probably be a deacon in the
church at Wild Horse—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will not. All I got to do is look at Clint an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
see how a half-grown kid has got a check rein on him.
That scares me a plenty.” He shook his head in mock
despair, but his eyes gave him away. “Gallivantin’
into the hills, through ’steen million tons of snow, to
nurse a scalawag who—”</p>

<p>“He’s no scalawag, Lon Forbes.”</p>

<p>“Like to know why he ain’t. Nothin’ but a hobo
when you first met up with him.”</p>

<p>“Now, Lon, you know very well you told me you
thought he was a man from the ground up. Those were
the very words you used.”</p>

<p>“Well, a hobo may be a man,” he defended. “Anyways,
that don’t mean you’d ought to bust up yore
happy home to hike over the hills for him.”</p>

<p>“Justin’s been talking to you,” she charged.</p>

<p>“Maybeso, an’ maybe not. That ain’t the point.
While Clint’s away, it’s up to me to run the Diamond
Bar K.”</p>

<p>“With Justin’s help,” she cut in.</p>

<p>Betty thought, though she did not express it in words,
that Lon would have his hands full if he intended to
take charge of her activities as a part of the ranch. She
knew that this would never have occurred to him as
included in his duties if it had not been suggested by
Merrick.</p>

<p>“I’m not askin’ any one’s help. I reckon I’m as
grown-up as I’ll ever be. Anyways, Clint put me in
charge, figurin’ I was man-size an’ competent. Question
is, Would yore father want you up here?”</p>

<p>Betty decided to carry the war indignantly into the
territory of the enemy. “Of course, he would. After
knowing Dad all these years I should think you’d be
ashamed to doubt him. Dad pays his debts. He’s a
good friend. This boy—this young fellow Hollister—tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> 
to do us a good turn after we had behaved pretty
bad to him. You know Dad has been looking for a
chance to help him. Well, it’s come. What are we
going to do about it? Go through—or quit on the job?”</p>

<p>“Go through. I ain’t proposin’ anything else. But
you don’t have to stay here. I can look after him, an’
Merrick’ll see you home.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about nursing?” she scoffed.
“Or cooking? You know what the doctor said. He’s
got to have nice things to eat after he gets a little better.
And good nursing. Dr. Rayburn told you—I heard
him say it—that he was glad I’d come because Mr.
Hollister needs a woman’s nursing.”</p>

<p>Lon scratched his head to help him think. It was
sometimes a laborious process. He knew cattle and
crops, but chaperoning a young woman was untried
territory.</p>

<p>“Times has changed, Betty,” he explained. “You
kinda growed up helter-skelter an’ run wild. But you’re
a young lady now, an’ you can’t be too careful. You
gotta think about what folks’ll say.”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks! What’ll they say? What can they
say if you stay up here with me? It’ll be only a day or
two till Dad gets home. It’s just that you’ve been
getting notions from Justin. He’s a city man and
doesn’t know our ways. But you’ve always lived here,
Lon. I’m surprised at you.”</p>

<p>“O’ course there ain’t any real harm in yore stayin,”
he conceded hesitantly. “I’ll be here to look after you
an’ see Prowers don’t trouble you. An’ it won’t be long.”</p>

<p>“I’m staying because I really can help, Lon. Justin
thinks it’s only foolishness, but you know it isn’t. In
Denver, where he lives, there are plenty of trained
nurses, but it’s different here. If Bridget could get in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
I wouldn’t say a word about staying. But she can’t.
If I went away and left this poor boy, you’d never
respect me again.”</p>

<p>“I would, too. But there. You’re gonna stay. I see
that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.” She caught the lapels of the big foreman’s
coat and coaxed him with the smile that always
had proved effective with him. “And you know I’m
right. Don’t you, Lon?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ of the kind,” he blustered. “An’ you needn’t
try to come it over me. I know you too blamed
well, miss. You’re bound an’ determined to have yore
own way—always were since you were a li’l’ trick
knee-high to a duck. Trouble is, you’ve been spoiled.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she admitted, “and you did it.”</p>

<p>“No such a thing. I always did tell Clint he’d find
out some day what’d come of lettin’ you boss the whole
works.” To save his face he finished with a peremptory
order. “Don’s fixin’ up some supper. Soon as you’ve
had yours, why, you’ll go right straight to bed. Doc
an’ me are aimin’ to look after Hollister to-night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lon,” Betty replied meekly. She had got what
she wanted, and she was willing to propitiate him by a
demure obedience calculated to remove the sting of her
victory.</p>

<p>Don opened the door and announced that supper was
ready.</p>

<p>Betty saw Merrick’s eye flash a question at Forbes as
they came into the larger room. She went directly to
him. Betty was a woman; therefore complex. But she
usually expressed herself simply.</p>

<p>“It’s all settled, Justin. Lon is going to stay with
me.”</p>

<p>He made no answer in words, but his salient jaw set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
grimly. Like many masterful men, he did not relish
defeat.</p>

<p>They drank coffee from tin cups and ate bacon,
tomatoes, and beans served in tin plates. Don’s biscuits
were appetizing, and four or five pans of them disappeared
before his guests were fed.</p>

<p>Betty lived up to the promise she had made Lon. She
whispered with Dr. Rayburn for a minute, then said
“Good-night” to the company generally, and vanished
into her bedroom.</p>

<p>The day had been a full one. To come in over the
snow had taxed the strength of her muscles. She was
tired, and, as she sat before the glowing coals taking the
pins out of her hair, she yawned luxuriously.</p>

<p>Just now her mind was on Merrick. The vague disappointment
in their relationship had crystallized to-day
into definite dissatisfaction. To use one of her father’s
expressions, Justin and she had not come out of the same
pasture. They thought in different languages.</p>

<p>That he had not sympathized with the urge in her to
spend herself in service for the wounded man was
important beyond the immediate question. And, even
if he did not agree with her, he should have understood
her obligation to do as she thought best. It involved
their whole future. The trouble was that he did not
recognize her right to follow the guidance of her own
judgment. She must defer to him, must accept his decision
as final.</p>

<p>Betty knew she could not do that. In essence she was
a twentieth-century woman.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>A CHILD OF IMPULSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> went to sleep critical of Justin. She woke, in the
dawn of a new day streaming through the window, to
censure of her own conduct. Willful though the girl
was, she had a capacity for generosity that saved her
from selfishness.</p>

<p>It was just as Lon said, her thoughts ran. She had to
boss everybody and everything, always had to have her
own way without regard to others. No wonder Justin
did not like it. If she had tried hard enough, she could
have made him see that this adventure was a duty laid
on her, one she could not escape and retain her self-respect.
Instead, she had managed so badly that she had
thrown him quite out of sympathy with her point of
view.</p>

<p>A child of impulse, she decided swiftly as she dressed
to have a little talk with him and say she was sorry.
With this resolve came peace. Everything would be all
right now between them.</p>

<p>Hollister smiled when she came to his bedside and
asked him how he was. His face reassured her. It was
very pale, but it held the look of one who means to get
well. Dr. Rayburn backed its promise.</p>

<p>“He’s doing fine. Fever gone down a lot. Nursing’s
the thing now, Miss Betty. You can do more for him
than I can.”</p>

<p>“Are you going back to town to-day?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Got to. No two ways about that. Be back day after
to-morrow probably. Keep giving him the tablets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Every two hours. And a teaspoon of the liquid three
times a day.”</p>

<p>They had drawn away from the bedside and by mutual
consent passed out of the door into the sunshine.
The crisp morning air was delightful. A million glints
of light sparkled from the snow.</p>

<p>“He’s really better, isn’t he?” she asked eagerly,
and her voice throbbed with young life.</p>

<p>“Better, yes. But—sometimes a man seems definitely
to be on the mend and then he relapses without
any apparent cause. It’s too soon to say he’s getting
better. All I can say is that, if no unfavorable complications
set in, he ought to improve.”</p>

<p>“Ought you to leave him?”</p>

<p>He threw up his hands in an energy of exasperation.
“If you had half as much to do as I have, young lady—”</p>

<p>“I know, but if he’s really still in danger—”</p>

<p>“Danger!” fumed the doctor. “Do you think Mrs.
Pillsbury can wait for him to get out of danger?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know—”</p>

<p>“Babies are born when they’re born,” he sputtered.
“I’ve got to leave for town right after breakfast.”</p>

<p>Justin came round the corner of the house. Betty
almost ran to give him her hand. Her eyes were shining
wells of friendliness.</p>

<p>“I want to see you after breakfast,” she whispered.</p>

<p>He nodded, non-committally.</p>

<p>Black called from inside, “Yore coffee’s b’ilin’, folks.”</p>

<p>He gave them flapjacks and syrup.</p>

<p>“I love flapjacks,” Betty told him.</p>

<p>Their host said nothing, but he was pleased.</p>

<p>Lon came in late and drew up a chair beside Betty.
“How’s everything this glad mo’ning?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Fine as the wheat.” She added as an aside, “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
the bossy little flapper isn’t half so bossy as she sometimes
lets on.”</p>

<p>His grin met her smile. They understood each other
very well and were still friends. Betty pushed into the
back of her mind a fugitive wish that Justin could know
and appreciate her as well as good old Lon did.</p>

<p>After breakfast Betty and Merrick took a short
walk.</p>

<p>“Scrumptious day,” she commented. Then, as
though it were a continuation of the same thought:
“I’m sorry, Justin.”</p>

<p>“You mean—?”</p>

<p>“I’m kinda horrid sometimes. I flare out and say ‘I
will’ or ‘I won’t’ like a spoiled kid. That’s no way to
do.” She smiled at him, a little whimsically, a little
apologetically. “It keeps me busy eating humble pie.”</p>

<p>He accepted her apology graciously. “Shall we forget
it, Bess? It’s a new day. We’ll turn a page of the ledger
and begin again.”</p>

<p>Rather timidly, she went on: “I had to come. It’s
not that. But if I hadn’t been so tempery, I could have
made you understand.”</p>

<p>He stiffened at once. “I think I understood—perfectly.”</p>

<p>“No, Justin. That’s just it. You didn’t, or you
wouldn’t have stood in my way. You’re fair-minded,
and when you see I was doing what I had to do—what
it was my duty to do—”</p>

<p>“I can’t agree with you about that, Betty. I’m older
than you are. I think I know more of the world. It’s not
your duty—the duty of any unmarried girl for that
matter, unless she is a trained professional nurse—to
put herself in the position you have.”</p>

<p>In spite of her good resolutions Betty began to feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
her temper slip. “What position have I put myself in?”
she asked quietly.</p>

<p>“I’m an old-fashioned man,” he answered. “I believe
that a young woman must be so circumspect that
nobody can find any ground to talk about her.”</p>

<p>“A girl isn’t a china doll. She can’t be put away in
moth balls, Justin. Every girl is talked about some time
or other by somebody if she’s alive. It’s of no importance
what gossips say.”</p>

<p>“It’s of the greatest importance that a girl give no
chance for idle gossip about her,” he demurred.</p>

<p>Betty’s irritation expressed itself in the voice, a
trifle sharp. “How do you think I can run the Quarter
Circle D E without being criticized? I’m there with the
men hours and days at a time, and no other woman on
the place except old Mandy, who is deaf as a post and
can’t see six feet from her nose. If any evil-minded
person wants to talk—why, I’ll just have to let him
talk.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I think you ought to have a foreman
run the place for you except for some general supervision.
It’s not a girl’s business.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it? You never told me so before.”</p>

<p>“You never asked me.”</p>

<p>“For that matter, I’m not asking you now.” Her
manner was dangerously quiet. It suggested banked
fires of anger. “But just the same I’m glad to have your
opinion.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to give it. I’ve wanted to tell you what I
think about it. Understand me. I admire your energy,
your enthusiasm, your efficiency. I believe you are
running the Quarter Circle D E better than a good many
men could do it. That’s not the question. Aren’t you
losing something you can’t afford to do without? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
can’t go into this in detail. Cattle-raising—ranching—breeding
Herefords—it’s a splendid occupation for
a man. But there’s a side of it that’s—well, I’d rather
you’d turn it all over to Forbes.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do—stay at home and
knit?”</p>

<p>“You know what I want as soon as the Sweetwater
project is finished.”</p>

<p>Betty side-stepped the proposed excursion into sentiment.
She was a downright young woman and wanted
to know exactly where she stood.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you felt that way about the ranch,
Justin. I thought you shared my view, that I was doing
something worth while when I raised hundreds of cattle
every year to help feed the world. If I had known you
thought I was degrading myself—” She stopped, a
tremolo of anger in her throat.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that, Betty.”</p>

<p>“It’s what you meant.”</p>

<p>“No. No, it isn’t. I meant only that—well, there’s
something very very precious that some girls have—that
you have, Betty—something that’s like the bloom
of a peach. If you lose it—well, it’s gone, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“And if I do anything that’s worth while—if I pay
my way in the world by giving value received—the
peach bloom is rubbed off, isn’t it?” she retorted scornfully.</p>

<p>“Aren’t there different ways of giving service? We
are in danger of forgetting the home, which is the normal
place for a young girl.”</p>

<p>“Is it? Thought you came from a city where thousands
of girls go down to offices and stores every morning
to earn a living.”</p>

<p>They stood on a small hilltop and looked over a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
world blanketed in white which flashed back countless
gleams of light to the heliographing sun, a world so
virgin clean, so still and empty of life, that it carried
Betty back to the birthday of the race. She was, miraculously,
at the beginning of things again.</p>

<p>“You’re not in a city fortunately,” he answered.
“There’s no economic pressure on you to fight sordidly
for a living.”</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled. “You’re not consistent. When
the city ways don’t suit you, I’m to live like people in
the country, but when you don’t approve of ranch ways,
then I’m to be like girls in Denver. I’m not to go
into business, but I’m not to be neighborly as my
mother was.”</p>

<p>“You’re distorting what I said, Betty.”</p>

<p>“Am I? Didn’t you say I wasn’t to help take care
of a sick man because it wasn’t proper?”</p>

<p>“I said you were acting rather absurdly about this
man Hollister,” he replied tartly. “There’s no call to
turn the world upside down because he’s wounded. You
want a sense of proportion.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s what you need, Justin,” she answered,
a flush of anger burning her cheeks. “You’ve been
horrid about it from the start without any reason.”</p>

<p>She moved down the hill toward the cabin. Merrick
walked beside her. His eyes were hard and his lips
set close.</p>

<p>For the first time it dawned upon Betty that he was
jealous of her interest in another man. He was possessive,
wanted to absorb all her thoughts, intended to be
the center of every activity she had. This did not please
her. It alarmed the individual in her. Marriage, as she
had dreamed it, was wonderful because it enhanced life.
It was the union of two souls, releasing all the better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
forces of their natures. Through it would come freedom
and not bondage. The joys of the senses would be
shared and transmuted to spiritual power. They ought
not to put chains on a man or a woman that would
narrow the horizon.</p>

<p>An illusion had been shattered. Justin was not the
man with whom she could walk hand in hand. She
sighed, and drew the gauntlet from her left hand.</p>

<p>Merrick looked at the ring she had dropped into his
hand, then straight at her with rigid gaze.</p>

<p>“Are you in love with this fellow Hollister? Is that
what it means?” he asked harshly.</p>

<p>The color in her cheeks deepened. “That’s—hateful
of you, Justin,” she said, her voice ragged with feeling.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen it for some time. You’re infatuated with
him.”</p>

<p>She lifted her chin and looked at him with eyes that
blazed anger. “Now I know I’ve done right in giving
you back your ring. I’m not going to—to quarrel
with you because you insult me. It’s finished. That’s
enough.”</p>

<p>A sob rose to her throat and choked her. She hurried
on to escape him, the trail a blurred mist through her
tears.</p>

<small>FATHOMS DEEP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days followed each other, clear, sparkling, crisp,
with mornings in which Betty’s lungs drew in a winey
exhilaration of living, with evenings which shut the
cabin on the slope of Pegleg Pass from a remote world
of men and women engaged in a thousand activities.</p>

<p>Betty had time to think during the long winter nights
after she had retired to her room. Some of her thoughts
hurt. She was shocked at the termination of her engagement,
at the manner of it. That was not the way it
should have been done at all. She and Justin should
have recognized frankly that their views of life could
not be made to harmonize. They should have parted
with esteem and friendship. Instead of which there
had been a scene of which she was ashamed.</p>

<p>Her cheeks burned when she recalled his crass charge
that she was infatuated with Hollister. Why hadn’t
he been able to understand that she had signed a pact
of friendship with the ex-service man? If he had done
that, if he had been wise and generous and sympathetic
instead of harsh and grudging, he would (so Betty persuaded
herself) have won her heart completely. He
had been given a great chance, and he had not been
worthy of it.</p>

<p>Merrick had humiliated her, shattered for the time at
least the gallant young egoism which made her the mistress
of her world.</p>

<p>Her father came up as soon as he returned from Denver.
She talked over with him the break with her fiancé.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Clint supported her, with reservations that did not
reach the surface.</p>

<p>“Never did like it,” he said bluntly, referring to her
engagement. “Merrick’s a good man in his way, but
not the one for you. I been figuring you’d see it. I’m
glad this came up. His ideas about marriage are crusted.
He’d put a wife in a cage and treat her well. That
wouldn’t suit you, Bess. You’ve got to have room to
try your wings.”</p>

<p>She clung to him, crying a little. “You don’t blame
me, then, Dad?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. You did right. If Merrick had been the
proper man for you, he’d have understood you well
enough to know you had to come here. Maybe it wasn’t
wise to come. Maybe it was impulsive. I reckon most
folks would agree with him about that. But he’d have
known his Betty. He’d ’a’ helped you, even though it
was foolish. You wouldn’t be happy with any man who
couldn’t let you fly the coop once in a while.”</p>

<p>“Was it foolish to come, Dad?” she asked.</p>

<p>He stroked her dark hair gently. “It’s the foolishness
we all love in you, honey—that way you have of giving
till it hurts.”</p>

<p>Betty had inherited her impulsiveness from him. He,
too, could be generous without counting the cost. He
rejoiced in the eagerness with which her spirit went out
to offer the gift of herself. But he had to be both father
and mother. Generosity might easily carry her too far.</p>

<p>“I do such crazy things,” she murmured. “And I
never know they’re silly till afterward.”</p>

<p>“This wasn’t silly,” he reassured her. “I’d have
figured out some other way if I’d been home. But I
wasn’t. Rayburn says your cooking an’ your nursing
have helped young Hollister a lot. I’m glad you came,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
now it’s over with. I reckon you’ve paid my debt in
full, Bettykins.”</p>

<p>“He’s absurdly grateful,” she said. “I haven’t done
much for him. You’d think I’d saved his life.”</p>

<p>“Soon now we’ll be able to get him back to the ranch
and Bridget can take care of him. Ruth’s wearyin’ for
you. I’ll be more satisfied when we’re there. I’ve got
old Jake Prowers on my mind some. Never can tell
what he’ll be up to.”</p>

<p>Hollister was grateful to Betty, whether absurdly so
or not is a matter of definitions. His big eyes followed
her about the room as she cooked custards with the
eggs and milk brought from the Howard place just
below. “Sweet Marie” did not entrance him when
Black tunelessly sang it, but the snatches of song she
hummed at her work filled the room with melody for
him. She read “David Copperfield” aloud after he began
to mend, and his gaze rested on her with the mute
admiration sick men are likely to give charming nurses
overflowing with good-will and vitality. Her laugh lifted
like a lark’s song. Even her smile had the radiant quality
of one who is hearing good news.</p>

<p>He noticed that she was no longer wearing Merrick’s
ring, and his thoughts dwelt on it a good deal. Was the
engagement broken? He could not see that she was
unhappy. Her presence filled the place with sunshine.
It was a joy to lie there and know that she was near,
even when she was in another room and he could not
see her. There was something permeating about Betty
Reed. She lit up men’s souls as an arc-light does a dark
street.</p>

<p>He hoped that she and Merrick had come to the parting
of the ways. The engineer was the last man in the
world to make her eager spirit happy. His strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
never spent itself in rebellion. He followed convention
and would look for the acceptance of it in her. But
Betty was cast in another mould. What was important
to him did not touch her at all, or, if it did, seemed a
worthless sham. She laughed at social usage when it
became mere formalism. No doubt she would be a disturbing
wife. Life with her would be exciting. That was
not what Justin Merrick wanted.</p>

<p>The right man for her would be one who both loved
and understood. He must be big enough to let her enthusiasms
sweep over their lives and must even give
them moral support while they lasted. Also, he must be
a clean and stalwart outdoor man, not one who had been
salvaged from the yellow swamp waters of vice. This
last Hollister kept before him as a fundamental necessity.
He laid hold of it to stamp down the passionate
insurgent longings that filled him.</p>

<p>It was an obligation on him. He must not abuse her
kindness by forgetting that he had been an outcast, had
himself shut a door upon any future that included the
fine purity of her youth. An effect of her simplicity was
that he stood in constant danger of not remembering
this. There was nothing of the Lady Bountiful about
Betty. Her star-clear eyes, the song and sunlight of her
being, offered friendship and <i>camaraderie</i> with no assumption
of superior virtue. She saw no barrier between
them. They came together on an equal footing as comrades.
The girl’s unconscious generosity enhanced her
charm and made the struggle in his heart more difficult.</p>

<p>Those days while he lay there and gathered strength
were red-letter ones in his life. Given the conditions, it
was inevitable that he should come to care for the
gracious spirit dwelling in a form that expressed so
lovingly the mystery of maiden dreams. In every fiber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
of him he cherished her loveliness and pulsed to the
enticement of her.</p>

<p>She gave the dull cabin atmosphere. A light burned
inside her that was warm and bright and colorful. Black
looked on her as he might a creature from another world.
This slip of a girl had brought something new into
the range rider’s life, something fine and spiritual which
evoked response from his long-dormant soul. He had till
now missed the joy of being teased by a girl as innocent
and as vivid as she.</p>

<p>Hollister was won the easier because her tenderness
was for him. Black must hunt ptarmigan for broth,
Clint Reed go foraging for milk and eggs. They submitted
cheerfully to be bullied in the interest of the
patient. His needs ruled the household, since he was an
invalid. Betty pampered and petted and poked fun at
him, all with a zeal that captivated his imagination.</p>

<p>In the evenings they talked, three of them in a semi-circle
before the blazing logs, the fourth sitting up in the
bed propped by pillows. The talk ranged far, from cattle
to Château-Thierry. It brought to the sick man a new
sense of the values of life. These people lived far from
the swift currents of urban rush and haste, but he found
in them something the world has lost, the serenity and
poise that come from the former standards of judgment.
The feverish glitter of post-war excitement, its unrest
and dissatisfaction, had left them untouched. Betty
and her father were somehow anchored to realities.
They did not crave wealth. They had within themselves
sources of entertainment. The simple things of life
gave them pleasure. He realized that there must be
millions of such people in the country, and that through
them it would eventually be saved from the effects of
its restlessness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>BETTY MAKES A DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">To-morrow</span>,” Betty said, and did a little skip-step
across the floor to put away the frying-pan she had
been washing.</p>

<p>“You have dancing feet,” Hollister told her.</p>

<p>“When I have a dancing heart.”</p>

<p>To the man sitting before the fire she bloomed in that
dark cabin like a poppy in the desert. She was a hundred
miracles each hour to him. He saw the exquisite
mystery of her personality express itself in all she was
and did—in the faint crimson just now streaming
through her cheeks beneath the warm and tawny skin,
in the charmingly shy gesture with which she had
accepted his compliment, in the low, vibrant voice that
played so wonderfully on his heartstrings. Not often
is a sweet and singing soul clothed so exquisitely in a
body of grace so young and lissom and vital.</p>

<p>“And that’s whenever there’s an excuse for it,” he
said, smiling at her. “But why feature to-morrow?
Is it your birthday?”</p>

<p>“We’re going home to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Are you? I didn’t know.”</p>

<p>He fell silent, looking into the fire. It was not an unexpected
announcement. These good days could not go
on forever. She had done more for him than any other
friend he had ever had. But, of course, life made its
claims on her. She had to respond to them. It was a
wholly undeserved happiness that she had stayed till
he was out of danger and on the road to health. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
wanted to tell her how he felt about it, but he would
never be able to do that. Inside, he seemed to melt to
a river of tears whenever he let himself dwell on her
amazing goodness to one who had been dead when first
she gave him her little hand and now was alive again.</p>

<p>“Umpha, to-morrow. I’m crazy to see Ruthie, and
what the boys are doing on the ranch.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been an awful nuisance,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you?” The little laugh that welled out of
her was sweet and mocking. It enveloped him with her
gracious and tender young womanhood.</p>

<p>He liked to think that her nursing had pulled him
through just as earlier her faith had rekindled in him
self-respect and courage. The facts might not quite
justify this, but he did not intend to let brutal actualities
murder a beautiful dream.</p>

<p>“But you can always point with pride, as the politicians
say. I’m a credit to your nursing. Off your
hands in ten days.”</p>

<p>“You’re not off my hands yet. You’re going to the
Diamond Bar K with us.”</p>

<p>The blood drummed faster through his heart. He
felt a stinging of the senses. Was there no end to the
goodness of this astonishing and disturbing girl? Must
she always be flinging out life lines to him?</p>

<p>“Good of you—awf’ly good of you.” He looked at
the fire, not at her. His voice was suspiciously low.
“I might have known, knowing you. But I can’t impose
myself any longer. I’ll be all right now at the
camp.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Dad and I will quit in the middle of a
good job? No, sir. We’re going to get credit for finishing
it. Lon’s breaking the road with a sled to-day.
You’re to go down in it. Dr. Rayburn says he hasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
time to go up to the camp to look after your bandages.
You’ll have to put up with us for a while.”</p>

<p>“I could go to the hotel at Wild Horse,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“You’ve never eaten a meal there. I see that. It’s
impossible. No, it’s all settled. You’re coming to the
ranch.”</p>

<p>“Of course you know I can’t ... I can’t ... thank
you.” His voice shook. This annoyed him. He told
himself savagely not to act like a baby.</p>

<p>“Oh, everybody works at the Diamond Bar K,” she
said lightly. “Ruthie can’t go to school through the
deep snow. You claim to be a college man. We’ll find
out whether you can teach the First Reader and two
times two.”</p>

<p>He tried to answer in the same spirit. “If you’re
going to call every bluff I make, I’ll be more careful.
Anyhow, I didn’t study the First Reader at college.
Don’t think they teach it at Massachusetts Tech.”</p>

<p>Later in the day he spoke to Reed on the subject. “I
don’t want to make a nuisance of myself. I can put up
at the Wild Horse House till I’m strong enough to go
back to camp.”</p>

<p>Reed had come out of the old-time cattle days when
there were always a plate and a bed at the ranch for
whoever might want them. He still kept open house.</p>

<p>“Always room for one more, boy. Anyhow, if Betty’s
got it fixed up that way in her mind, you’d as well make
up yours to do as she says. It’ll be her say-so.” The
owner of the Diamond Bar K grinned at him confidentially,
as one fellow victim of feminine tyranny to another.</p>

<p>Forbes arrived late in the afternoon and reported
heavy roads. He had brought a four-horse team, and it
had been all they could do to break through. They had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
dragged a sled with the body of a wagon on the wide
runners.</p>

<p>“Deep drifts below the rim in the cut the other side o’
Round Top. Be all right if the wind don’t blow to-night,”
he said.</p>

<p>The wind blew, and was still whistling when it came
time to start. But the sun was shining and the sky clear.</p>

<p>Betty was doubtful, on account of the patient.</p>

<p>“If we wrop him up good, he’ll be all right,” Lon said.
The big foreman did not want to stay in the hills until
the trail he had broken was filled up again with drifts.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Reed.</p>

<p>Tug and Betty were tucked in with warm blankets.
Forbes took the reins and drove out of the draw, past
the Howard place, and up the steep hill beyond. Betty
had seen to it that her patient was wrapped to the nose
in an old fur coat of her father. The whipping wind did
not distress him.</p>

<p>From the summit they could see the great white wastes,
stretching mile on mile. The snow was soft and heavy,
and the wind had not drifted it a great deal since Lon
had driven through the previous day. But the horses
were pulling a load, and soon the sweat stood out on
their bodies.</p>

<p>They reached and circled Round Top, passed a treacherous
dugway, and moved into the deep drifts below the
rim. Betty looked up once and a little shudder ran down
her spine. The wind up on the bluff had a clean sweep.
Over the edge yawned a great snow comb that might at
any moment loosen and come down to bury them in an
immense white mausoleum. It might, on the other
hand, hang from the rim for months.</p>

<p>Lon cracked his whip close to the ear of the off leader.
It might almost have been a signal. From far above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
came the sound of an answering crack. Reed looked up
quickly. The snow comb slid forward, broke, and came
tearing down. It gathered momentum in its plunge,
roaring down like an express train.</p>

<p>The cowman flung Betty into the bed of the sled and
crouched over her as a protection against the white
cloud of death rushing at them.</p>

<p>The avalanche swept into the ravine with thunderous
noise, a hundred tons of packed snow. The bulk of its
weight struck in front of the horses, but the tail of the
slide whipped a giant billow upon them and buried team
and sled.</p>

<p>Betty fought and scrambled her way out of the snow.
From it her father’s head was emerging a few yards
away.</p>

<p>“Hurt?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. You?”</p>

<p>“Jarred up. That’s all. Seen anything of Lon?”</p>

<p>The head and broad shoulders of the foreman pushed
up. Lon shook snow out of his hair, eyes, and ears.</p>

<p>The others exchanged bulletins with him. He was,
he said, as rampageous as a long-legged hill two-year-old.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hollister!” Betty quavered.</p>

<p>The engineer was nowhere to be seen. They called,
and no answer came. Betty’s heart dropped like a plummet.
She turned upon her father anguished eyes. They
begged him to do something. He noticed that her
cheeks were blanched, the color had ebbed from her lips.
His daughter’s distress touched him nearly. He could
not stand that stricken look.</p>

<p>“I’ll find him,” he promised.</p>

<p>Jammed between two trees, upside down, with one
end sticking out of the snow, they found the wagon bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
at the bottom of the ravine. Forbes spoke to Reed in a
low voice, for his ears alone.</p>

<p>“Not a chance in fifty of findin’ him in all this snow,
an’ if we do, he’ll not be alive.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the ranchman. “If a fellow knew
where to look. But no telling where the snow carried
him.”</p>

<p>“Might still be under the wagon bed, o’ course.”</p>

<p>“Might be.”</p>

<p>A low groan reached them. They listened. It came
again, from under the bed of the wagon apparently.</p>

<p>“He’s alive,” Clint called to Betty.</p>

<p>The drooping little figure crouched in the snow
straightened as though an electric current had been shot
through it. The girl waded toward them, eager, animate
with vigor, pulsing with hope.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad. Let’s hurry. Let’s get him out.”</p>

<p>Reed rapped the wagon bed with his knuckles. “How
about it, Hollister? Hurt much?”</p>

<p>“Knocked out,” a weak voice answered. “Guess I’m
all right now. Arm scraped a bit.”</p>

<p>The handle of a shovel stuck out of the snow like a
post. Lon worked it loose, tore the lower part free, and
brought it to the bed. He began to dig. Reed joined
him, using his leather gauntlets as spades. It took
nearly half an hour to get Hollister out. He came up
smiling.</p>

<p>“Cold berth down there,” he said by way of comment.</p>

<p>“You’re not really hurt, are you?” Betty said.</p>

<p>“Nothing to speak of. The edge of the sled scraped
the skin from my arm. Feels a bit fiery. How about the
horses?”</p>

<p>Lon and his employer were already at work on them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Three of the animals had pawed and kicked till they
were back on their feet. The men helped them back to
the road, after unhitching them from the sled. It was
necessary to dig the fourth horse out of a deep drift into
which it had been flung.</p>

<p>Betty sat beside Hollister in the wagon bed on a pile
of salvaged blankets. She felt strangely weak and
shaken. It was as though the strength had been drained
out of her by the emotional stress through which she had
passed. To be flung starkly against the chance, the
probability, that Tug was dead had been a terrible experience.
The shock had struck her instantly, vitally, with
paralyzing force. She leaned against the side of the bed
laxly, trying to escape from the harrowing intensity of
her feeling. That she could suffer so acutely, so profoundly,
was a revelation to her.</p>

<p>What was the meaning of it? Why had the strength
and energy ebbed from her body as they do from one desperately
wounded? It was disturbing and perplexing.
She had not been that way when her father was shot.
Could she find the answer to the last question in the way
she had put it? Desperately wounded! Had she, until
hope flowed back into her heart, been that?</p>

<p>“You’re ill,” she heard a concerned, far-away voice
say. “It’s been too much for you.”</p>

<p>She fought against a wave of faintness before she answered.
“I suppose so. It’s—silly of me. But I’m
all right now.”</p>

<p>“It’s no joke to be buried in an avalanche. Hello!
Look there!”</p>

<p>Her gaze followed the direction in which he was pointing,
the edge of the bluff above. Two men were looking
down from the place where the slide had started. It
was too far to recognize them, but one carried a rifle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
They stood there for a minute or two before they withdrew.</p>

<p>“Do you think—that they—?”</p>

<p>His grave eyes met hers. “I think they attempted
murder, and, thank God! failed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything to Dad—not now,” she cautioned.</p>

<p>He nodded assent. “No.”</p>

<p>Reed had looked at his watch just before the avalanche
had come down on them. The time was then ten
o’clock. It was past two before the outfit was patched
up sufficiently to travel again.</p>

<p>Not till they were safely out of the hills and gliding into
Paradise Valley did the cowman ask a question that had
been in his mind for some time.</p>

<p>“Why do you reckon that slide came down at the
very moment we were in the ravine?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been wonderin’ about that my own se’f. O’
course, it might just a-happened thataway.” This from
Forbes.</p>

<p>“It might, but it didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’?”</p>

<p>“There was an explosion just before the slide started.
Some one dynamited the comb to send it off the bluff.”</p>

<p>“Are you guessin’, Clint? Or do you know it for a
fact?”</p>

<p>“I’m guessing, but I pretty near know it.”</p>

<p>Betty spoke up, quietly, unexpectedly. “So do Mr.
Hollister and I.”</p>

<p>The two ranchmen pivoted simultaneously toward
her. They waited, only their eyes asking the girl what
she meant.</p>

<p>“While you were digging, Mr. Hollister saw two men
up there. He pointed them out to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“And why didn’t you show ’em to me?” demanded
her father.</p>

<p>“What would you have done if I had?” she countered.</p>

<p>“Done! Gone up an’ found out who they were,
though I could give a good guess right now.”</p>

<p>“And do you think they would have let you come
near? We could see that one of them had a rifle. Maybe
both had. They didn’t stay there long, but I was
afraid every second that you’d look up and see them.”</p>

<p>The foreman grunted appreciation of her sagacity.
“Some head she’s got, Clint. You’d sure have started
after them birds, me like as not trailin’ after you. An’
you’d sure never have got to ’em.”</p>

<p>The cowman made no comment on that. “He timed
it mighty close. Saw us coming, of course, an’ figured
how long it would take us to reach where we did. Good
guessing. An old fox, I’ll say.”</p>

<p>“Same here.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t miss smashing us twenty seconds,” Hollister
said. “As it was, that’s no kind of snowstorm to
be out in without an umbrella and overshoes.”</p>

<p>Betty looked at him and smiled faintly. It was all
very well to joke about it now, but they had missed being
killed by a hair’s breadth. It made her sick to think
of that cackling little demon up there on the bluff plotting
wholesale murder and almost succeeding in his plan.
She lived over again with a bleak sinking of the heart
that five minutes when she had not known whether Tug
Hollister was dead or alive.</p>

<p>If he had been killed! She knew herself now. Justin’s
instinct of selfishness had been right, after all. His niggardliness
resolved itself into self-protection. He had
been fighting for his own. Even his jealousy stood justified.
She had talked largely of friendship, had deceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
herself into thinking that it was expression of herself she
craved. That was true in a sense, but the more immediate
blinding truth was that she loved Hollister. It had
struck her like a bolt of lightning.</p>

<p>She felt as helpless as a drowning man who has ceased
struggling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br>

<small>WITHOUT RHYME OR REASON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an upsetting thing, this that had happened to
Betty, as decided and far less explainable than a chemical
reaction. It seemed to her as though life had suddenly
begun to move at tremendous speed, without any
warning to her whatever that Fate intended to step on
the accelerator. She was caught in the current of a
stream of emotion sweeping down in flood. Though it
gave her a great thrill, none the less it was devastating.</p>

<p>She wanted to escape, to be by herself behind a locked
door, where she could sit down, find herself again, and
take stock of the situation. To sit beside this stranger
who had almost in the twinkling of an eye become of
amazing import to her, to feel unavoidable contact of
knee and elbow and shoulder, magnetic currents of attraction
flowing, was almost more than she could bear.</p>

<p>Betty talked, a little, because silence became too significant.
She felt a sense of danger, as though the personality,
the individuality she had always cherished,
were being dissolved in the gulf where she was sinking.
But what she said, what Hollister replied, she could
never afterward remember.</p>

<p>Ruth ran to meet them with excited little screams of
greeting. “Hoo-hoo, Daddy! Hoo-hoo, Betty! Oh,
goody, goody!”</p>

<p>Her sister was out of the sled and had the child in
her arms almost before the horses had stopped. “You
darling darling!” she cried.</p>

<p>Buxom Bridget came to the door, all smiles of welcome.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
“And is it your own self at last, Betty mavourneen?
It’s glad we are to see you this day.”</p>

<p>Betty hugged her and murmured a request. “Better
fix up the south bedroom for Mr. Hollister. He ought to
rest at once. I’m kinda tired.”</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ I’ll look after him. Don’t you worry your
head about that. The room’s all ready.”</p>

<p>The girl’s desire to question herself had to be postponed.
She had reckoned without Ruth, who clung to
her side until the child’s bedtime. Pleading fatigue,
Betty retired immediately after her sister.</p>

<p>She slipped into a négligée, let her dark hair down so
that it fell a rippling cascade over her shoulders, and
looked into the glass of her dressing-table that reflected
a serious, lovely face of troubled youth. A queer fancy
moved in her that this girl who returned her gaze was a
stranger whom she was meeting for the first time.</p>

<p>Did love play such tricks as this? Did it steal away
self-confidence and leave one shy and gauche? She saw
a pulse fluttering in the brown slender throat. That was
odd too. Her nerves usually were steel-strong.</p>

<p>She combed her hair, braided it, and put on a crêpe-de-chine
nightgown. After the light was out and she was
between the sheets, her thoughts settled to more orderly
sequence. She could always think better in the dark,
and just now she did not want to be distracted by any
physical evidences of the disorder into which she had
been flung.</p>

<p>How could she ever have thought of marrying Justin?
She had spent a good deal of time trying to decide
calmly, without any agitation of the blood, whether she
was in love with him. It was no longer necessary for her
to puzzle over how a girl would know whether she cared
for a man. She knew. It was something in nature, altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
outside of one’s self, that took hold of one without
rhyme or reason and played havoc with dispassionate
tranquillity; a devouring flame clean and pure, containing
within itself all the potentialities of tragedy—of
life, of death, of laughter, love and tears.</p>

<p>And then, as is the way of healthy youth, in the midst
of her puzzlement she was asleep—and with no lapse of
time, as though a curtain had rolled up, she was opening
her eyes to a new day.</p>

<p>If Tug had let himself count on long full hours with
Betty in the pleasant living-room, of books and ideas to
be discussed together, of casual words accented to meaning
by tones of the voice and flashes of the eye, he was
predestined to disappointment. In the hill cabin they
had been alone together a good deal. She contrived to
see that this never occurred now. Except at table or in
the evening with Ruth and her father, he caught only
glimpses of her as she moved about her work.</p>

<p>Her eyes did not avoid his, but they did not meet in
the frank, direct way characteristic of her. She talked
and laughed, joined in the give-and-take of care-free
conversation. To put into words the difference was not
easy. What he missed was the note of deep understanding
that had been between them, born less of a common
point of view than of a sympathy of feeling. Betty had
definitely withdrawn into herself.</p>

<p>Had he offended her? He could not think how, but he
set himself to find out. It took some contriving, for
when one will and one will not a private meeting is not
easily arranged.</p>

<p>He was in the big family room, lying on a lounge in
the sunshine of the south window. Ruth had finished her
lessons and was on the floor busy with a pair of scissors
and a page of magazine cutouts. She babbled on, half to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
herself and half to him. They had become great friends,
and for the time she was his inseparable, perhaps because
he was the only one of the household not too busy
to give her all the attention she craved. Her talk, frank
with the egotism of childhood, was wholly of herself.</p>

<p>“I been awful bad to-day,” she confided cheerfully,
almost proudly. “Gettin’ in Bridget’s flour bin ’n’
ev’ryfing to make a cake ’n’ spillin’ a crock o’ milk on
the floor.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I been the baddest,” she reflected aloud enjoyably.
Then, unhampered by any theory of self-determination,
she placed the blame placidly where it belonged,
“When I said my prayers last night I asked
God to make me good, but he didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>Tug did not probe deeper into this interesting point of
view, for Betty came into the room with an armful of
books and magazines.</p>

<p>“Thought from what you said at breakfast you’re
hungry for reading,” she said. “So I brought you some.
If you’re like I am, you’ll want to browse around a
bit before you settle down. This Tarkington story is
good—if you haven’t read it. But maybe you like
Conrad better.”</p>

<p>Through the open door came a delicious odor of fresh
baking from the kitchen. Out of the corner of his eye
Tug took in Ruth. He sniffed the spicy aroma and audibly
sounded his lips.</p>

<p>“My! Cookies!” he murmured.</p>

<p>Instantly Ruth responded to the suggestion. She
scrambled to her feet and trotted out, intent on achieving
cookies at once. Betty turned to follow, but her
guest stopped her with a question.</p>

<p>“What’s the Tarkington story about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“About a girl who’s hanging on to the outskirts of society
and making all kinds of pretenses—a pushing
kind of a girl, who has to fib and scheme to get along.
But he makes her so human you like her and feel sorry
for her.”</p>

<p>“Sounds interesting.” He fired his broadside while he
still held her eyes. “Miss Reed, why am I being punished?”</p>

<p>Into her cheeks the color flowed. “Punished?” she
murmured, taken aback.</p>

<p>Betty had stopped by the table and half turned. He
reached for the umbrella he used as a support and hobbled
toward her. “Yes. What have I done?”</p>

<p>A turmoil of the blood began to boil in her. “The doctor
said you were to keep off your feet,” she evaded.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he said you were to entertain me—keep
me interested.”</p>

<p>“That was when you were too sick to read. And I’m
busy now. Lots of work piled up while I was away.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re not offended about anything.”</p>

<p>She had picked up a book from the table and was
reading the title. Her eyes did not lift to his. “What
could I be—offended about?” In spite of the best she
could do, her voice was a little tremulous.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. <i>Are</i> you?”</p>

<p>“No.” The lashes fluttered up. She had to meet his
gaze or confess that she was afraid to.</p>

<p>“You’re different. You—”</p>

<p>He stopped, struck dumb. A wild hope flamed up in
him. What was it the shy, soft eyes were telling him
against her will? He stood on the threshold of knowledge,
his heart drumming fast.</p>

<p>During that moment of realization they were lost in
each other’s eyes. The soul of each was drawn as by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
magnet out of the body to that region beyond space
where the spirits of lovers are fused.</p>

<p>Betty’s hands lifted ever so slightly in a gesture of ultimate
and passionate surrender to this force which had
taken hold of her so completely.</p>

<p>Then, with no conscious volition on the part of either,
they were in each other’s arms, swept there by a rising
tide of emotion that drowned thought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII<br>

<small>THE BLUEBIRD ALIGHTS AND THEN TAKES WING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tug</span> pushed Betty from him. Out of a full tide of feeling
he came to consciousness of what he was doing.</p>

<p>“I can’t. I can’t,” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>She understood only that something in his mind
threatened their happiness. Her eyes clung to his. She
waited, breathless, still under the spell of their great
moment.</p>

<p>“Can’t what?” at last she murmured.</p>

<p>“Can’t ... marry you.” He struggled for expression,
visibly in anguish. “I’m ... outside the pale.”</p>

<p>“How—outside the pale?”</p>

<p>“I’ve made it impossible. We met too late.”</p>

<p>“You’re not—married?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m ... I’m—” He stuck, and started again.
“You know. My vice.”</p>

<p>It took her a moment to remember what it was. To
her it was something done with ages ago in that pre-millennial
past before they had found each other. She
found no conceivable relationship between it and this
miracle which had befallen them.</p>

<p>“But—I don’t understand. You’re not—”</p>

<p>She flashed a star-eyed, wordless question at him,
born of a swift and panicky fear.</p>

<p>“No. I haven’t touched it—not since I went into
the hills. But—I might.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense! Of course, you won’t.”</p>

<p>“How do I know?”</p>

<p>“It’s too silly to think about. Why should you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“It’s not a matter of reason. I tried to stop before,
and I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“But you stopped this time.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I haven’t had the headaches. Suppose they
began again. They’re fierce—as though the top of my
head were being sawed off. If they came back—what
then? How do I know I wouldn’t turn to the drug for
relief?”</p>

<p>“They won’t come back.”</p>

<p>“But if they did?”</p>

<p>She gave him both her hands. There were gifts in her
eyes—of faith, of splendid scorn for the vice he had
trodden underfoot, of faith profound and sure. “If they
do come back, dear, we’ll fight them together.”</p>

<p>He was touched, deeply. There was a smirr of mist
obscuring his vision. Her high sweet courage took him
by the throat. “That’s like you. I couldn’t pay you a
better compliment if I hunted the world over for one.
But I can’t let you in for the possibility of such a thing.
I’d be a rotten cad to do it. I’ve got to buck it through
alone. That’s the price I’ve got to pay.”</p>

<p>“The price for what?”</p>

<p>“For having been a weakling: for having yielded to it
before.”</p>

<p>“You never were a weakling,” she protested indignantly.
“You weren’t responsible. It was nothing but
an effect of your wounds. The doctors gave it to you because
you had to have it. You used it to dull the horrible
pain. When the pain stopped and you were cured, you
quit taking it. That’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>He smiled ruefully, though he was deadly in earnest.
“You make it sound as simple as a proposition in geometry.
But I’m afraid, dear, it isn’t as easily disposed
of as that. I started to take it for my headaches, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
kept on taking it regularly whether I needed it for the
pain or not. I was a drug victim. No use dodging that.
It’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“Well, say you were. You’re not now. You never
will be again. I’d—I’d stake my head on it.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Because you are <i>you</i>. And your faith would
help me—tremendously. But I know the horrible
power of the thing. It’s an obsession. When the craving
was on me, it was there every second. I found myself
looking for all sorts of plausible excuses to give
way.”</p>

<p>“It hadn’t any real power. You’ve proved that by
breaking away from it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve regained my health from the hills and from my
work. That stopped the trouble with my head. But
how do I know it has stopped permanently?”</p>

<p>Wise beyond her years, she smiled tenderly. “You
mentioned faith a minute ago. It’s true. We have to
live by that. A thousand times a day we depend on it.
We rely on the foundations of the house not to crumble
and let it bury us. I never ride a horse without assuming
that it won’t kick me. We have to have the courage
of our hopes, don’t we?”</p>

<p>“For ourselves, yes. But we ought not to invite those
we love into the house unless we’re sure of the foundations.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure enough. And, anyhow, that’s a poor cold
sort of philosophy. I want to be where <i>you</i> are.” The
slim, straight figure, the dusky, gallant little head, the
eyes so luminous and quick, reproached with their eagerness
his prudent caution. She offered him the greatest
gift in the world, and he hung back with <i>ifs</i> and <i>buts</i>.</p>

<p>There was in him something that held at bay what he
wanted more than anything else on earth. He could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
brush aside hesitations with her magnificent scorn. He
had lost the right to do it. His generosity would be at
her expense.</p>

<p>“If you knew, dear, how much I want you. If you
knew! But I’ve got to think of you, to protect you from
myself. Oh, Betty, why didn’t I meet you two years
ago?” His voice was poignant as a wail.</p>

<p>“You didn’t. But you’ve met me now. If you really
want me—well, here I am.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re there, the sweetest girl ever God made—and
I’m here a thousand miles away from you.”</p>

<p>“Not unless you think so, Tug,” she answered softly,
her dusky eyes inviting him. “You’ve made me love
you. What are you going to do with me?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see you get the squarest deal I can give
you, no matter what it costs.”</p>

<p>“Costs you or me?”</p>

<p>The sound in his throat was almost a groan. “Dear
heart, I’m torn in two,” he told her.</p>

<p>“Don’t be, Tug.” Her tender eyes and wistfully smiling
lips were very close to him. “It’s all right. I’m just
as <i>sure</i>.”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “I’ve got to play the game,” he
said miserably.</p>

<p>Betty talked, pleaded, argued with him, but his point
of view remained unchanged.</p>

<p>A reaction of irritation swept her. It was in part offended
modesty. She had offered herself, repeatedly,
and he would not have her. How did she know that he
was giving the true reason? It might be only a tactful
way of getting rid of her.</p>

<p>“Play it then,” she replied curtly, and she walked out
of the room without another look at him.</p>

<p>He was astounded, shocked. He had been to blame,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
of course, in ever letting his love leap out and surprise
them. Probably he had not made clear to her the obligation
that bound him not to let her tie up her life with
his. He must see her at once and make her understand.</p>

<p>But this he could not do. A note dispatched by Ruth
brought back the verbal message that she was busy. At
supper Betty did not appear. The specious plea was
that she had a headache. Nor was she at breakfast.
From Bridget he gathered that she had gone to the
Quarter Circle D E and would stay there several days.</p>

<p>“Lookin’ after some fencing,” the housekeeper explained.
“That gir-rl’s a wonder if iver there was one.”</p>

<p>Tug agreed to that, but it was in his mind that the
fencing would have had to wait if affairs had not come to
a crisis between him and Betty. He had no intention of
keeping her from her home. Over the telephone he made
arrangements to stay at the Wild Horse House. Clint,
perplexed and a little disturbed in mind, drove him to
town.</p>

<p>Most of the way they covered in silence. Just before
they reached the village, Reed came to what was in his
mind.</p>

<p>“You an’ Betty had any trouble, Hollister?”</p>

<p>The younger man considered this a moment. “No
trouble; that is, not exactly trouble.”</p>

<p>“She’s high-headed,” her father said, rather by way
of explanation than apology. “But she’s the salt of the
earth. Don’t you make any mistake about that.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be likely to,” his guest said quietly.
“She’s the finest girl I ever met.”</p>

<p>The cowman looked quickly at him. “Did she go to
the Quarter Circle D E because of anything that took
place between you an’ her?”</p>

<p>“I think so.” He added a moment later an explanation:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
“I let her see how much I thought of her. It
slipped out. I hadn’t meant to.”</p>

<p>Reed was still puzzled. He knew his daughter liked
the young fellow by his side. “Did that make her
mad?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. I found out she cared for me.”</p>

<p>“You mean—?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” The face of the engineer flushed. “It was a
complete surprise to me. I had thought my feelings
wouldn’t matter because she would never find out about
them. When she did—and told me that she—cared
for me, I had to tell her where I stand.”</p>

<p>“Just where do you stand?”</p>

<p>“I can’t marry. You must know why.”</p>

<p>Clint flicked the whip and the young team speeded.
When he had steadied them to a more sedate pace, he
spoke. “I reckon I do. But—you’ve given it up,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” He qualified the affirmative. “I’m not the
first man who thought he’d given it up and hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“Got doubts about it, have you?”</p>

<p>“No. I think I’m done with the cursed stuff. But
how do I know?” Tug went into details as to the nature
of the disease. He finished with a sentence that was
almost a cry. “I’d rather see her dead than married to
a victim of that habit.”</p>

<p>“What did Betty say to that?”</p>

<p>“What I’d expect her to say. She wouldn’t believe
there was any danger. Wouldn’t have it for a minute.
You know how generous she is. Then, when I insisted
on it, she seemed to think it was an excuse and walked
out of the room. I haven’t seen her since. She wouldn’t
let me have a chance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see as there’s much you could say—unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
you’re aimin’ to renig.” Reed’s voice took on a trace of
resentment. “Seems to me, young fellow, it was up to
you not to let things get as far as they did between you
an’ Betty. That wasn’t hardly a square deal for her.
You get her to tell you how she feels to you, an’ then
you turn her down. I don’t like that a-tall.”</p>

<p>Tug did not try to defend himself. “That’s one way
of looking at it. I ought never to have come to the
house,” he said with humility.</p>

<p>“I wish you hadn’t. But wishing don’t get us anywhere.
Point is, what are we going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything to do. I’d take the first train
out if it would help any,” Hollister replied despondently.</p>

<p>“Don’t you go. I’ll have a talk with her an’ see how
she feels first.”</p>

<p>Hollister promised not to leave until he had heard
from Reed.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV<br>

<small>BORN THAT WAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was impossible for Betty to escape the emotions that
flooded her, but she was the last girl to sit down and accept
defeat with folded hands. There was in her a certain
vigor of the spirit that craved expression, that held
her head up in the face of disaster.</p>

<p>At the Quarter Circle D E she was so briskly businesslike
that none of the men would have guessed that she
was passing through a crisis. Except for moments of abstraction,
she gave no evidence of the waves of emotion
that inundated her while she was giving orders about
the fencing of the northwest forty or the moving of the
pigpens.</p>

<p>When she was alone, it was worse. Her longing for
Hollister became acute. If she could see him, talk with
him, his point of view would be changed. New arguments
marshaled themselves in her mind. It was ridiculous
to suppose that a man’s past—one not of his own
choosing, but forced on him—could determine his future
so greatly as to make happiness impossible. She
would not believe it. Every instinct of her virile young
personality rebelled against the acceptance of such a
law.</p>

<p>Tug’s persistence in renouncing joy had wounded her
vanity. But at bottom she did not doubt him. He had
stood out because he thought it right, not because he
did not love her. In spite of her distress of mind, she
was not quite unhappy. A warm hope nestled in her
bosom. She loved and was loved. The barrier between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
them would be torn down. Again they would be fused
into that oneness which for a blessed ten minutes had
absorbed them.</p>

<p>Her father drove over in the rattletrap car. Ostensibly
he had come to discuss with her plans for fertilization
and crops of the Quarter Circle D E for the coming
season.</p>

<p>“I took Hollister to town this morning. He wouldn’t
stay any longer,” Reed presently mentioned, as though
casually.</p>

<p>“Oh! Why wouldn’t he stay?” Betty was rather
proud of the indifference she contrived to convey in her
voice.</p>

<p>“Said he didn’t want to keep you away from home.”</p>

<p>“Was he keeping me away?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Seemed to think so. Wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I see you know all about it, Dad. What did he tell
you?”</p>

<p>“I asked him point-blank what the trouble was between
you and him. He told me.”</p>

<p>A faint crimson streamed into her cheeks. “What did
he say it was?”</p>

<p>“He’s afraid. Not for himself, but for you.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s awf’ly silly of him.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that, Bettykins. If there’s
any doubt whatever, he’d better wait till he’s certain.”
He let his arm fall across her shoulders with a gentleness
she knew to be a caress. “Have you found the man you
want, dear? Sure about it?”</p>

<p>She smiled ruefully. “I’m sure enough, Dad. He’s
the one that seems in doubt.” To this she added a reply
to a sentence earlier in his period. “He didn’t say anything
to me about waiting. His ‘No, thank you,’ was
quite definite, I thought.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Clint’s wrath began to simmer. “If he’s got a notion
that he can take or leave you as he pleases—”</p>

<p>Betty put a hand on his arm. “Please, Dad. I don’t
mean what I said. It’s not fair to him. He doesn’t
think that at all.”</p>

<p>“There’s no man in the Rockies good enough for
you—”</p>

<p>“Are you taking in enough territory?” she teased, her
face bubbling to mirth. “I don’t even know whether
you’re including Denver. Justin came from there, and
he’s too good for me.”</p>

<p>“Who says he’s too good?”</p>

<p>“Too perfect, then. I couldn’t live up to him. Never
in the world.” Her eyes fixed on something in the distance.
She watched for a moment or two. “Talking
about angels, Dad. There’s the flutter of his engine
fan.”</p>

<p>Reed turned.</p>

<p>Merrick was killing the engine of his runabout. He
came across to them, ruddy, strong, well-kept. Every
stride expressed the self-reliant and complacent quality
of his force.</p>

<p>The girl’s heart beat faster. She had not seen him
since that moment, more than two weeks ago, when they
had parted in anger. Her resentment against him had
long since died. He had not been to blame because they
were incompatible in point of view and temperament.
It was characteristic of her that she had written to ask
him to forgive her if she had in any way done him a
wrong. If she could, she wanted to keep him for a friend.</p>

<p>He shook hands with them. Reed asked about the
work.</p>

<p>“We’ve finished the tunnel and are laying the line of
the main canal between it and the draw where it runs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
into Elk Creek Cañon. Soon as the ground is thawed
out, I’ll have dirt flying on it,” the engineer said.</p>

<p>“Lots of water in the dam?” asked the cowman.</p>

<p>“Full up. The mild weather this last week has raised
it a lot. There’s a great deal of snow in the hills. We’ll
have no difficulty about a sufficient supply.”</p>

<p>“Good. You’ve got old Jake Prowers beat.”</p>

<p>“Justin has done a big thing for this part of the
country. That’s more important than beating Mr.
Prowers,” Betty said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Merrick impersonally. “By the way,
the old fellow is still nursing his fancied injuries. He
was hanging around the dam yesterday. I warned him
off.”</p>

<p>“Say anything?” asked Clint.</p>

<p>“Tittered the way he does and congratulated me on
the good job I had done. He’s a venomous old snake,
but I don’t see that he can do us any harm. There’s
nothing left to do now but the detail work of putting in
the ditches.”</p>

<p>They talked for a few minutes about the irrigation
project. The engineer did not betray the least self-consciousness,
but his mind, too, was running on the
last time he had seen Betty and the break between
them.</p>

<p>Reed was called away by one of the men to look at a
sick horse.</p>

<p>Merrick’s steady gaze at once challenged Betty. “I
got your letter.”</p>

<p>She was a good deal less composed than he. It disconcerted
her to know that she was blushing. That was
a silly way to do, she told herself. It annoyed her to
give an exhibition of gaucherie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“I’ve come to the conclusion that we made a mistake,”
he said. “We rushed into a decision too hastily.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Betty agreed.</p>

<p>“You’re young. I hadn’t given enough consideration
to that. Shall we forget our differences and be as
we were, Betty?”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean—be engaged?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Justin, I can’t. I thought you meant we’d made
a mistake in ever being engaged. We did. We’re not
suited to each other.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you. Your letter convinced me
that we are.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean it that way at all,” she said unhappily.
“We’re not, Justin. Not a bit. I’m too—too
kinda wild for you. You don’t want a wife like me. If
you knew, you wouldn’t want me a bit.”</p>

<p>“I’m the best judge of that,” he answered, smiling a
little.</p>

<p>“But you don’t. I’d always be troubling you with
my crazy ways.”</p>

<p>“No. It’s just that you’re young,” he insisted.</p>

<p>“It isn’t. I’m born that way. I’ll always be like
that. Besides—” She stopped, searching for a way to
put it gently. “Besides, I’d want a husband—if I
ever marry at all—who needs me, who has to have me,
who can’t get along without me.”</p>

<p>“I need you,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh no, you don’t. Not really. You think you do,
maybe, but not in the way I mean. You’re strong—self-sufficient.
Please, I don’t mean it in an uncomplimentary
way. But you <i>are</i> big, you know. A wife would
have to fit into you—be just a—an important detail
of your life. I couldn’t do that. I’ve got to be everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
to a man—help him—talk over his difficulties
with him—be just the biggest thing in the world to
him. I couldn’t really <i>do</i> anything for you. You’re
complete. You don’t need anything done for you. With
or without me, you’re going to be awf’ly successful. Oh,
I know it sounds silly, but it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you like me less because I’m reliable
and efficient and—well, I take your own word—on the
road to success? Would you want to marry an irresponsible
failure?”</p>

<p>The allusion was plain, and she did not like him better
for it. None the less, she recognized that this man, standing
there in the quiet arrogance of strength, had qualities
admirable and worthy of great respect. He was master
of himself and, so far as one can be, of his destinies.
The cleft chin, the square jaw, the cold gray eyes so keen
and steady, expressed character, and of a kind that
would take him far. But it was a road she would not
travel with him.</p>

<p>“No. But I’d like to know that I was a help to my
husband in making his success. You can’t understand,
Justin. I’m not what you want—not at all. If you
saw me as I am, you’d know it. I’d always be affronting
your sense of the fitting thing. The right wife for you is
one who would sit at the head of your table well-dressed,
handsome, and charming, an evidence of your standing
in the community. You know—a gracious hostess,
good at teas and bridge and that sort of thing. You’re
really a city man. I’m not a city woman and never shall
be.”</p>

<p>To Merrick, clear-eyed in spite of his fondness for her,
came a flash of insight that told him she had been wiser
than he. He could never mould this wildling to his
heart’s desire. Some day he would look back on this episode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
and smile at it. But he had not reached that state
of philosophy yet. His vanity was still engaged, and
more than that—the last passionate flame of the boy
in him that was being sacrificed to ambition. He craved
inordinately the willful charm of this devastatingly
sweet girl with the quick, disturbing eyes. She represented
to him certain values he was deliberately trampling
down, not because they did not seem to him good,
but because they warred with something that he wanted
more. He had impossibly dreamed that she might stay
what she was and yet become something different.</p>

<p>“Are you going to marry Hollister?” he asked.</p>

<p>She might reasonably have told him this was a private
matter of her own. She might have evaded the question.
Instead, she told him the truth.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Has he asked you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But you will if he does.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Knowing what he has been, what he may be again?”</p>

<p>“Knowing what he is,” she corrected.</p>

<p>“Will girls never get over the folly of marrying men to
reform them?” he flung out impatiently.</p>

<p>“I’m not marrying him to reform him—that is, if
I’m marrying him at all, which isn’t likely. He does not
need reforming.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he won’t slide back into his vice?”
He answered his own query. “You can’t know. There’s
no way of knowing.”</p>

<p>“He won’t.” She said it quietly, with absolute conviction.</p>

<p>Her attitude tremendously irritated him. It was a reflection
on all the copybook virtues that had made him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
what he was. “Are you waiting for this tramp, this
drug fiend, to make up his mind whether he wants to
marry you or not?”</p>

<p>There was a spark of anger in her eye. She would not
modify even his phrasing. It could stand as he put it.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Sheer perversity.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” she agreed, with dangerous sweetness.</p>

<p>He knew he was being punished for having indulged
himself, as he rarely did, in a display of temper. At once
he took himself in hand.</p>

<p>“I’m serious about this, Betty. A girl has no right
to take chances of this sort. I grant you Hollister has
qualities—splendid ones. But the damning fact remains.”</p>

<p>Betty relented. He was human. He had cried out because
he was hurt. “I don’t think it remains, Justin.
I’m absolutely convinced that it’s conquered—what
you call his vice.”</p>

<p>“What I call his vice! Wouldn’t every sane person
call it that?”</p>

<p>“Not if they knew the circumstances. He was left
with terrible pains in the head after he was wounded.
They gave him morphine—a lot of it. He got to depending
on it. The habit grew on him. Then he woke
up and shook it off. It’s to his credit rather than the
reverse.”</p>

<p>“Even so. There’s a danger that he’ll go back to it.”</p>

<p>And again she denied it, with the certainty of one who
does not need evidence to bulwark an absolute assurance.
“No danger at all.”</p>

<p>They were standing in front of the porch. Reed came
toward them from the stable. Both knew that the last
word had been said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Justin Merrick struggled with himself a moment,
then held out his hand. He did not want to be a poor
loser.</p>

<p>“The best of luck, Betty,” he said.</p>

<p>Gladness gleamed in the soft eyes through which the
eager spirit seemed to yearn to comfort him.</p>

<p>“You, too, Justin,” she whispered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV<br>

<small>BIRDS OF A FEATHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> sat on opposite sides of a table, the food and
dishes not yet cleared away after their supper. A cheap
kerosene lamp lit the room insufficiently. The smoke
from a ragged wick had entirely blackened one side of
the glass chimney. One of the men had cunningly utilized
this to throw the face of his companion into the
light while his own remained in shadow. His bleached
eyes watched the emotions come and go as they registered
on the twisted, wolfish countenance of this criminal
on the dodge. He was playing on his evil instincts
as a musician does upon the strings of a violin.</p>

<p>“Me, I said right away, soon as I seen you, ‘This
Cig’s no quitter; he’ll go through.’ So I tied up with
you. Game, an’ no mollycoddle. Tha’s how I sized
you up.”</p>

<p>“You got me right, Prowers. I’ll say so.”</p>

<p>The little man with the leathery face watched his victim.
In the back of his mind a dreadful thought had
lodged and become fixed. He would use for his purpose
this vain and shallow crook, then blot him out of life before
he turned upon him.</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it? Cig ain’t roostin’ up here for his
health, I says to myself. Not none, by jiminy by jinks.
He’s got business.”</p>

<p>“Business is right,” agreed the New Yorker. “An’
soon as it’s done, I ain’t stickin’ around dis dump no
more. I’m duckin’ for ’Frisco. But get it straight,
Prowers. I taken all de chances I’m gonna take alone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
See? An’ it’ll cost you two hundred iron men for my
share of de job.”</p>

<p>“Not that much, Cig. We’ve both got our reasons
for wantin’ to pull this off. Clint Reed an’ his foreman
ain’t exactly friends of yours. You got yore own account
to settle. But I’ll dig up a hundred. That’ll take
you to ’Frisco.”</p>

<p>Cig looked at his mild vis-à-vis sullenly. This harmless-looking
old fellow was his master in villainy, more
thorough, more ruthless. There were times when his
bleached eyes became ice-coated, when the New Yorker
had sensed back of them the crouched threat of the
coiled rattlesnake. If he had known what Prowers was
thinking now, he would have shuddered.</p>

<p>“Some generous guy, youse are,” he sneered. “An’
how do I know youse won’t rap on me—t’row me down
when de rubes make de big holler after de job?”</p>

<p>The old cattleman was at his suave mildest. No malignity
showed in his smile. “I don’t reckon I can give no
written guarantee, Cig, but I never sawed off trouble
yet on a fellow takin’ the trail with me. Those who have
rode with me could tell you that.”</p>

<p>The crook from the East was uneasy. He did not
know why. His restlessness drove him to the door of the
cabin from which he looked out upon a cynical moon
riding high above the tops of the pines. He shivered.
This bleak world of white appalled his city-cramped
spirit. It had been bad enough in summer. Now it was
infinitely worse.</p>

<p>“Looks like there’s a hoodoo on me,” he growled.
“It’s de Gawd-forsaken country that puts a jinx on me.
I’m losin’ me noive. Every job I tackle is a flivver.
After dis one, it’s me for de bright lights.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. A getaway for you, pronto.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“When do we get busy?”</p>

<p>“To-night,” Prowers answered. “Merrick has left
two watchmen at the dam. One of ’em lives at Wild
Horse. His wife’s sick. He got a call half an hour
ago sayin’ she was worse. He’s hittin’ the trail for
town.”</p>

<p>“Leavin’ one guy on de job. Do we bump him off?”</p>

<p>“Not necessary. A quart of bootleg whiskey reached
him this afternoon. Time we get there, he’ll be dead to
the world.”</p>

<p>“You sent de booze?”</p>

<p>“Merrick didn’t,” Prowers answered, with his impish
grin.</p>

<p>“Sure he ain’t on de wagon?”</p>

<p>“Dead sure. He can’t leave it alone.”</p>

<p>“Looks like a lead pipe,” Cig admitted. “But de jinx
on me—When I gunned dat Tug Hollister I’d ’a’
swore I got him good. Nothin’ works.”</p>

<p>Jake could not quite forbear sarcasm. “You’d ought
to take one o’ these here correspondence courses in efficiency.
It’ll be different to-night, though. I ain’t used
to fallin’ down on anything I go after.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ that I do?” Cig demanded sourly out of
the corner of a drooping mouth.</p>

<p>“Meanin’ you ain’t been lucky lately. Let it go at
that.”</p>

<p>Prowers moved about making his preparations. The
dynamite and the fuses already made ready were put in
a gunny-sack. The tools were packed. Beneath his
coat Jake put on a gaberdine vest, for it was possible
that the weather might turn cold.</p>

<p>Presently both men were ready. The cattleman blew
out the light and they passed from the cabin into the
starry night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>They did not go direct to the dam. Prowers had in
him too much of the fox for that. He would not leave
tracks in the snow that might later take him to the penitentiary.
Their footsteps followed the beaten trail that
ran from the cabin to a road meandering down into Paradise
Valley by the line of least resistance.</p>

<p>Half a mile from the point where they struck it, another
road deflected from this one, leading to Merrick’s
camp at the Sweetwater Dam. Into this they turned.
The snow had been beaten down by scores of passing
feet. The top crust did not break beneath their weights,
so that no evidence would be left written there as to who
had made this midnight trip of destruction.</p>

<p>Cig’s eye took in the ghostly white hills and he shivered.
“Gawd, what a dump!” he groaned. His vocabulary
was as limited as his emotions. He could never get
used to the barren grandeur of the Rockies. They awed
and oppressed him. They were too stark and clean for
him. He struggled with a sense of doom. In cities he
never thought of death, but premonitions of it had several
times shaken his ratlike courage since he had been
here. Twice he had dreamed that he was being buried in
these hills and had wakened in a cold sweat of horror.
He made up his mind to “beat it” for the Pacific coast
at once.</p>

<p>They came down into the bowl where the dam was,
skirting the edge of the timber to attract as little attention
as possible in case a watchman should be on his
beat. No sign of life disturbed the stillness. They crept
to the tents and made a hurried survey. In one of them
a man lay on a cot asleep. He was fully dressed. His
arms were outflung and he was breathing stertorously.
A bottle, one third full, stood on a small table close to
the cot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“Like I said, dead to the world,” Prowers commented.</p>

<p>He turned away. Cig swiftly snatched the bottle and
slipped it inside his coat. He wanted a drink or two
pretty badly, and, like enough, Prowers wouldn’t let
him have them if he knew.</p>

<p>The two men crossed the dam-head to the gates.</p>

<p>“It’ll be here,” the cowman said as he put down the
gunny-sack.</p>

<p>Before they set to work, Cig concealed his bottle, but
in the course of the hours that followed he made frequent
visits to the spot where he had hidden it. Since
Prowers was neither blind nor a fool he became aware of
what the other was trying to keep from him. He said
nothing. The bulk of the work fell on him. No complaint
came from his lips. There was a curious smile on
them, ironic, cruel, and unhuman.</p>

<p>Cig was in turn gay, talkative, maudlin, and drowsy.
His boastings died away. He propped himself against
the cement wall close to the gates and swayed sleepily.
Once or twice he cat-napped for a few moments.</p>

<p>The old man continued to prepare the charges. Once,
watching his accomplice, he broke into a cackle of mocking
mirth, so sinister that Cig would have shuddered if
he had been alive to impressions.</p>

<p>The tramp slid down to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>“Done up. Shleep a li’l’ ’f you don’ min’,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Presently he was in a drunken slumber.</p>

<p>Prowers finished his work and lit the fuses. He looked
at the weak and vicious instrument he had been using, a
horrible grin on his leathery, wrinkled face.</p>

<p>“You comin’ or stayin’?” he asked squeakily.</p>

<p>The doomed man snored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“Suit yoreself,” the little devil-man said. “Well, if I
don’t see you again, good-bye. I got to be hittin’ the
trail right lively.”</p>

<p>He moved briskly along the great wall of the dam,
climbed the steps at the far end, and followed the road
leading out of the basin. Once he turned to look at the
deep lake lying placidly behind the rampart Merrick had
built to hold it.</p>

<p>A great flash and roar filled the night. Even where
Prowers stood, he felt the shake of the earth. Masses of
torn concrete, of rock and sand, were flung into the air.
The echoes of the explosion died, but another sound
reached the anarchist on the hillside. He listened, with
the diabolical grin on his lips, to a murmur of rushing
waters.</p>

<p>The Sweetwater Dam was going out.</p>

<p>“The Flat Tops are liable to be irrigated good an’
plenty, looks like,” he murmured. “Well, this is no
place for sight-seers.”</p>

<p>He shuffled along the trail, the Satanic smile still on
his leathery face.</p>

<p>It would have vanished promptly if he had known
that a pair of eyes were looking down on him from the
shadow of a pine above the road.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI<br>

<small>A STORMY SEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>, about to return to the Quarter Circle D E, found
herself importuned by her small sister to take her along.</p>

<p>“I’ll be the goodest, ’n’ not bovver you, ’n’ go to bed
jes’ the minute you say to,” she promised.</p>

<p>The older sister hesitated, then turned to her father.
“Why not? I’m staying there only one night.”</p>

<p>“Fine. Take Little Nuisance along,” Reed said, and
poked a forefinger into Ruth’s softly padded body.
“I’ve got to go to town, anyhow, an’ won’t be back till
late.”</p>

<p>It was nearly two weeks since Betty had shaken hands
with Justin Merrick and closed in good-will a chapter of
her history. She had not seen Tug Hollister since then,
but word had reached her that he had gone back to work
in the hills. Merrick’s men were on the Flat Tops running
the lines where the ditches were to go.</p>

<p>She was waiting for Tug to come to her. Surely he
did not intend to let things end between them as they
were. He would ride up some day and tell her that he
had been a stiff-necked idiot who had at last seen the
light. Every day she had looked for him, and her eyes
had moved up the road in vain.</p>

<p>In the pleasant sunshine Ruth prattled cheerfully of
puppies, dolls, gingerbread, Sunday school, her new pink
dress, and warts. Betty came out of a brown reverie at
the name of Hollister.</p>

<p>“I fink he might come an’ see us. I’m jes’ as mad at
him,” the child announced. “’N’ I’m gonna tell him
so, too, when he comes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“If he comes,” Betty found herself saying with a little
sigh.</p>

<p>She knew that if he did not make the first move she
would take the initiative herself. A little point of pride
was not going to stand in the way of her happiness. But
she believed he ought to come to her. It was a man’s
place to meet a girl more than halfway.</p>

<p>It was, of course, some fantastic sense of duty that
was holding him back. She had not very much patience
with it. Why was he not generous enough to give her a
chance to be generous about this fault he magnified so
greatly? He did not seem to appreciate her point of view
at all.</p>

<p>On Betty’s desk at the Quarter Circle D E an unopened
letter lay awaiting her. She had never seen Hollister’s
writing, but at the first glance after she picked up
the envelope her heart began to hammer. She knew who
the message was from. The postmark was Wild Horse.
Evidently the mailman had delivered it an hour or two
earlier.</p>

<p>She tore the flap and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ever since I saw you last I have been close to happiness in
spite of my distress. You love me. I tell myself that over and
over. I cling to it and rest in it. For this is the greatest thing
that ever came into my life.</p>

<p>I wish, dear, dear friend, that I could show you my heart.
I wish you could understand how great is the temptation to
throw away discretion and accept this wonderful gift. A
thousand times I have been over the ground, trying to persuade
myself that you are right and my caution a coward’s
fear with no basis in reason. But I can’t. I can’t. Before I
dared to take your life into my keeping, I would have to be
sure. And how can I be? How can I <i>know</i> that this horrible
thing won’t rise up some day and throttle your happiness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Why did I not meet you before I had given hostages to this
destructive menace? I keep asking myself why. I can find no
answer that is not born in bitter mockery.</p>

<p>If you could know what you have done for me, how you
have rebuilt my faith in good, in God! No man ever had so
wonderful a friend.</p>
</div>

<p>That was all, except the signature at the bottom. But
it made her heart sing. Her doubts were at rest. He
loved her. That was all she wanted to know. The difficulties
in his mind would vanish. Her love would beat
them down. What scruples, what fears could stand
against this joy that flooded them both?</p>

<p>She longed to tell him so, to pour her heart out in what
was to be the first love-letter she had ever written. Yet
she was not impatient of the delays forced on her by
ranch details, by Ruth’s imperious demands for attention.
She could attend to these competently and without
irritation because subconsciously her being floated
in happiness. Life had always given Betty what she
wanted. It was unthinkable that there should be withheld
from her that which was the crown of all her hopes.</p>

<p>Alone at the desk in the living-room, after everybody
else on the ranch had retired, Betty gave herself up to
the luxury of dreams. She felt very wide awake. It
would not be possible to sleep until she had written an
answer. There was no hurry about it. She wanted to
take plenty of time to think out what she wanted to say
before she even started on it.</p>

<p>When she began to write, her thoughts flew fast.
They kept busy the flashing finger-tips that transmitted
the messages to the white page on the carriage of the
typewriter. The sentences were short, impulsive, energetic.
They expressed the surge of eagerness in her.</p>

<p>She knew she would copy it in long hand, would go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
over every word of every sentence. The other side of
her, the shy-eyed maiden of dreams who must be the
wooed and not the wooer, would insist on deleting, trimming
down, making colorless the swift and passionate
staccato of the words. The letter she would send to Hollister
would be pale and neutral compared to this cry of
the heart she was uttering.</p>

<p>The little glass-cased clock on her desk struck two.
Betty was surprised. She had been here alone with her
thoughts for four hours. The fire in the grate had died
down and the room was beginning to chill. She gathered
the live coals and put upon them two split lengths of
resinous pine.</p>

<p>For a few minutes she sat before the blaze warming
her hands. That was the obvious reason for her staying.
A more compelling one was that she saw pictures in the
coals, dream pictures of the future in which two figures
moved to the exclusion of all others. These had the texture
of fiction, not consciously, but because our conceptions
of the future must always be adjusted to a reality
affected by environment and human character.</p>

<p>Betty lifted her head and listened. What was that
rushing, swishing sound? She rose, startled, affected
instantly by a sense of insecurity and danger. Something
crashed heavily against the wall. The floor
seemed to weave.</p>

<p>She went to the window and looked out into the darkness.
A river, swift and turbid, was roaring past where
the lawn had been a few minutes before. The girl stood
terrified, her mind caught in the horror of unknown
disaster. Even as she stood there, she saw that the
waters were rising.</p>

<p>Again there sounded a rending crash of timbers. Like
a battering-ram the end of a telephone pole smashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
through the side of the house, crossed the room, and
came to rest in the fireplace. With it came a rush of
water that covered the floor.</p>

<p>Betty screamed. Her panicky heart beat wildly.
Was the world coming to an end? She looked out again.
What she saw was appalling—a swirl of rising waters
tossing like the backs of cattle on a stampede. She
noticed that the barn, plainly visible a few moments
before, had vanished from sight.</p>

<p>The sloshing tide in the room was rising. Already it
reached the bottom of her skirts. There was no longer
any doubt that the floor was tilting. The house had been
swept from its foundations. Built of frame, it was tossing
on the face of a rough sea.</p>

<p>Betty waded to the stairway, climbing over the
telephone pole. Except Ruth and the old colored woman
Mandy there was nobody in the house with her. Both
of these were sleeping on the second floor. In the bunkhouse
were three men employed by her, but she realized
that it, too, must have been carried away.</p>

<p>The girl flew upstairs from the pursuing flood. She
knew now that it must have been caused by the breaking
of the Sweetwater Dam. The Quarter Circle D E
ran along a narrow valley down which must be pouring
all the melted snow and rainfall impounded in the big
reservoir.</p>

<p>Pounded by the impact of the descending waters, the
house rocked like a boat. The lights had gone out when
the wires had become disconnected, but Betty groped
her way into the room where her sister lay asleep in the
moonlight. She was running to pick up the child when
Mandy’s voice stopped her. It came in an excited wail.</p>

<p>“De day of judgment am hyeh, honey. Oh, Lawdy,
Lawdy, we’re sure come to de River Jordan!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>The greatest bulwark of courage is responsibility.
The old woman’s helpless collapse steadied her. A
moment before she had known no sensation but terror.
Now there poured back into her the sense of obligation.
She had two children on her hands, one old and one
young. She must be a rock upon which they could lean.</p>

<p>Betty stepped out of the room and closed the door in
order not to waken Ruth. She noticed that the two
lower steps of the stairway were already submerged.</p>

<p>“The dam’s gone out, Mandy. We’re caught in the
flood,” she explained.</p>

<p>In despair Mandy threw up her brown palms. She
was a short, fat woman with an indistinguishable waist-line.
A handkerchief was knotted round her head for a
nightcap.</p>

<p>“This am shore de night of Armagideon when de four
ho’semen of de Epolipse am a-ridin’. Oh, Lawd, where
am you at when pore black Mandy am a-reachin’ fo’
you-all?”</p>

<p>A lurch of the house flung her against Betty. She
clutched at the girl and clung to her. Her eyes rolled.
She opened her mouth to scream.</p>

<p>Betty clapped her hand over it. “Stop that nonsense,
Mandy! I’ll not have it!” she ordered sharply. “You’ll
waken Ruth. We’re all right so long as the house holds
together. I’ll not have any of your foolishness.”</p>

<p>The old woman’s mouth closed. The words of Betty
were astringent. They assumed leadership, which was
all that Mandy wanted. Her voice obediently abated to
a whimper.</p>

<p>Betty did not open her mind to the colored woman.
There was no use in filling her with alarms she had not
yet conjured up. But the girl knew their situation was
desperate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>At the lower end of the rock-girt valley was a gateway
where the hogbacks on either side of it came almost
together. There was room enough for a wagon to get
through and no more. Out of this gap all the water
rushing into the narrow basin would have to pour to the
Flat Tops below. If the Sweetwater Dam had gone
out—and of that Betty had no doubt—the floods
would race down for hours much faster than they could
escape to the mesa. The churning stream would grow
deeper instead of subsiding. The house might waterlog
and sink. It might turn over. It might be rammed by
trees or rocks. Or it might be beaten by the waves until
it fell apart.</p>

<p>“I’m going in to Ruth,” Betty said. “If you’re
coming, too, you’ll have to behave, Mandy. I’ll not
have you frightening her by any silly hysterics.”</p>

<p>“Yas’m,” assented Mandy meekly.</p>

<p>Ruth was still asleep, though the roar of the sweeping
waters came through the open window and occasionally
a drench of spray. Her sister went to close the casement.
Above, the moon was shining placidly; below, the
current boiled and churned. The depth of the stream,
Betty guessed, must be eight or ten feet. It was still
rising, but the force of its downward rush was terrific.</p>

<p>The house pitched like a boat. What was worse, it
had tilted so that water was pouring in at the lower
windows. If the stream continued to rise, it would
probably either sink or overturn.</p>

<p>The noise of crashing timbers and beating waves continued.
Betty wondered how much pounding an old
frame building like this could stand. It was built with
an ell, the wing a later addition to the farmhouse. The
binding beams connecting the two parts creaked and
groaned under the strain put upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Ruth woke. Betty sat down on the bed and put her
arms round the child.</p>

<p>“What ’tis?” asked the child, frightened.</p>

<p>“Some of the water got out of the dam and we’re
floating in it, dearie. Don’t cry, Ruthie. Betty’ll be
here with you all the time.”</p>

<p>There came a series of heavy bumps accompanied by
the sound of rending timbers. It was as though the
floor was being torn from under their feet. Betty
thought they were going down. The house listed
sharply, then righted itself so suddenly that the girl was
flung to the bed.</p>

<p>The house had been torn asunder, one wing from the
other.</p>

<p>Mandy and the child screamed. For a moment Betty
was near panic herself. But she fought down her terror
resolutely.</p>

<p>“See. The floor’s level now.” Her voice was steady
and calm. “We’ll probably be all right. Stop that
noise, Mandy. Didn’t I tell you I wouldn’t have it?”</p>

<p>The housekeeper sniffled. “I’m ce’tainly scared to
death, honey, I shorely is.” She folded her short, fat
arms and rocked. “I been a mighty triflin’ nigger, but I
aims frum now on to get shet uv my scandalacious ways
an’ travel de road what leads to de pearly gates. Yas’m.
Glory Hallelujah! If de good Lawd evah lets me git
outa hyeh alive, I’ll shout for salvation at de mourners’
bench mighty loud.”</p>

<p>The situation was too desperate for Betty to find any
amusement in Mandy’s good resolutions, but it occurred
to her to turn some of her fear into another
channel.</p>

<p>“Let’s sing,” she suggested.</p>

<p>Above the booming of the wild waters she lifted her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
clear young soprano and sang “Safe in the Arms of
Jesus.” The first line she carried alone, then Mandy’s
rich contralto quavered in and Ruth’s small piping
treble joined.</p>

<p>With an impact that shook every timber the current
flung the house against a great boulder. The building
swung as on a pivot and was driven into the rocks again.
Betty looked out of the window. They were wedged
between two great spars of red sandstone. The furious
buffeting of the racing tide lifted their frail refuge and
dropped it upon the sharp edges of the crags.</p>

<p>“We’re caught at the Steeples,” the girl told the
others.</p>

<p>If they could get out and climb the rock spires! But
that was impossible. The house was submerged almost
to the second floor in the swashing torrent which surrounded
it and dragged at it with a violence they could
feel.</p>

<p>Again the shipwrecked three sang. This time it was
“Rock of Ages.” They held one another’s hands for
comfort, and in their prayer, voiced through the words
of the old hymn, they found a sustaining strength.
Presently Mandy took up “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,”
and the others came in with support.</p>

<p>Betty helped to wear away the long night with talk.
She forced into her voice cheerfulness and courage,
though there was not a minute of the dark hours not
filled with alarms. It would be morning soon, she
promised. Daddy would come and get them, or Lon, or
perhaps Justin Merrick’s men who were camping on the
Flat Tops. Then they would have fun talking it all over
and telling how brave Ruth had been for not crying
(except just the teentiest time) like a silly little girl.</p>

<p>After what to those in peril seemed an eternity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
waiting, light sifted into the sky with a promise of the
coming day. The darkness lifted and showed them a
valley of wild and turbid waters. The Quarter Circle
D E ranch had become a furious and rushing river flung
back upon itself by the hogbacks which dammed its
free course.</p>

<p>In the darkness it had seemed that the menace of the
flood had been tenfold increased by the unknown peril
that lay back of the visible. But in the light they
could see too much. The force of the torrent was appalling.
It showed them to what a puny reed of safety
they were clinging. At any moment the building might
collapse like an empty eggshell under pressure.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVII<br>

<small>HOLD THE FORT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollister</span> was wakened by a sound of lapping outside
his tent. It was a noise feeble as the meowing of little
kittens. At first he thought it must be a memory from
his dream. When he had gone to bed the stars had
filled the sky above the dry and arid mesa where they
were camped. No rain could have fallen in sufficient
quantity to make even a rivulet.</p>

<p>But the rippling continued. The source of it puzzled
the engineer. He flung back the bedding and rose. A
chill shocked through him. His feet were in ice-cold
water an inch or two deep.</p>

<p>Rapidly he dressed and then stepped through the
flap of the tent. A shallow sheet of water covered the
ground except where there were hillocks. Apparently
it was flowing toward the south, as though before the
pressure of a greater volume not in sight.</p>

<p>Tug walked to the tent of his chief and called him.
Merrick answered sleepily, but at the words, “trouble
at the dam,” he became instantly alert. Three minutes
later he joined his assistant.</p>

<p>One glance satisfied him. “The dam’s gone out,” he
said quietly.</p>

<p>Neither by word nor manner did he betray what a
blow this was to him. That which he had given two of
the best years of his life for, had worked and fought for
with all the brains and strength he possessed, was now
only a menace to the community instead of a hope. It
was a staggering disappointment. He had builded so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
surely, so safely, yet somewhere must have been a miscalculation
that had brought disaster.</p>

<p>“The water’s probably coming through the Quarter
Circle ranch,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes. We’d better rouse the men and get right up
there. There may be danger if the valley gets flooded.”</p>

<p>Tug did not wait for the others. His words had expressed
only palely the alarm he felt. If the break in the
dam was a serious one—and it must be to have reached
the mesa so quickly—the Quarter Circle must inevitably
be flooded. He knew Betty was at her ranch.
One of the men had mentioned in his hearing that he had
seen her and Ruth going up the afternoon before. He
was worried—very greatly worried.</p>

<p>His long strides carried him over the ground fast, but
his fears moved faster. Presently he quickened his pace
to a run. Dawn was at hand. He was splashing through
water five or six inches deep.</p>

<p>Swinging round a bend in the road, he pulled up for a
moment in dismay. Through the gap in the hogback,
beyond which was the Quarter Circle D E ranch, a solid
stream of water was pouring. Its flow was as steady and
as constant as that of a river.</p>

<p>Cut off from the road, he splashed through a deepening
stream to the foot of the hogback. It was a stiff
quarter of an hour’s climb to reach the rock-rim below
the ridge. He grudged the two or three minutes’ delay in
finding a practicable ascent up the twenty-five-foot rim,
for he was in a desperate hurry. Hand over hand he
went up the face of the rock, clinging to projecting
knobs, to faults in the surface, and to shrubbery rooted
in narrow crevices. Over the edge of the sandstone he
drew himself to the level surface above.</p>

<p>One glance from the summit showed him a valley submerged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Most of the cattle had evidently escaped to the
higher ground, warned by the first of the flood as it
poured down. He could see the upper hillside dotted
with them. The barn, the bunkhouse, the ranch house
itself, were all gone. Fragments of them might be
made out on the surface of the lake that had formed—if
one could call a pent-up, raging torrent by such a
name.</p>

<p>His eyes swept the valley in search of the ranch house.
He found one of the eaves sticking out of the current.
All the rest of the overturned building was under
water.</p>

<p>The strength oozed from his body. He was terribly
shaken. If Betty was in the house—and he had no reason
to suppose that she was not—she must have gone
down in the flood. He could not, he would not believe it.
And yet—</p>

<p>Again his glance moved down the valley. His gaze
stopped at some rock spires known as the “Steeples.”
Some part of a building, much battered by the waves,
was caught there. Even as he looked, his heart leaped.
For from a window a white flag was streaming. He
could see now that some one was leaning out and waving
a sheet or a tablecloth.</p>

<p>He hurried down the hogback, every nerve of him
quivering with desire to answer that appeal for help.
He must get to her—at once—before the smashing
current tore down and devoured her precarious and
doubtful haven. Even as he went leaping down the
hillside to the shore, his mind was considering ways and
means.</p>

<p>A swimmer could not make it straight through the
tumbling waters to the Steeples. He would be swept
down and miss his goal. From what point should he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
start? He tried to decide this as he ran up the valley
close to the edge of the water.</p>

<p>Opposite the point where the pasture-wire fence ran
up the hill, a spit of higher land extended into the
flooded area. He found a cedar post flung up by the
waves.</p>

<p>Tug took off his shoes and his coat. He waded out,
pushing the post before him. Presently he was in deep
water. The swift current was sweeping him before it. He
fought to get farther out in the stream, but he saw that
the fencepost was impeding him. It came to him that
he would be carried past the Steeples if he could not
make more headway across the valley.</p>

<p>He let the fencepost go and struck straight across
with a strong, long stroke. The drag of the rushing
water was very powerful, and he had continually to
watch out for floating planks and timbers racing toward
the gap between the hogbacks.</p>

<p>The cold from the melted snow in the uplands chilled
him to the marrow. He had not fully rebuilt his blood
from the illness he had been through. Before he had
been in the stream many minutes, he knew that the
force in him was failing. The velocity of the flow was
too mighty for him to resist. Tossed here and there by
conflicting sets of the current, he drifted as helplessly as
a chip in a rough sea. His arms moved feebly. His legs
were as though weighted. Soon now, he had no doubt,
his head would sink and the waters close above it.</p>

<p>Then, out of a clear sky, a miracle occurred. It took
the form of a rope that dropped from heaven, descended
in a loop over his head and one arm, tightened, and
dragged him from the racing channel into an eddy.</p>

<p>Three men were at the other end of the rope. They
were standing on the roof of a one-story building that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
had stranded on a submerged island. A group of three
cottonwoods had caught the floating building and held
it against the pressure of the flood.</p>

<p>The exhausted swimmer was dragged to the roof. He
lay there, completely done, conscious, but no more than
that.</p>

<p>“Where in Mexico you haided for, anyhow?” a voice
drawled.</p>

<p>Hollister looked up. The speaker was the cowboy
Dusty, who had once dragged him back to the Diamond
Bar K ranch at the end of a rope. One of the others he
recognized as the lank rider Burt, who also had been
present on that occasion.</p>

<p>“Lucky you were here,” the rescued man said. “I
was all in.”</p>

<p>“Tha’s twice I done roped you,” Dusty reminded
him. “I sure got bawled out proper last time. Say,
howcome you in this Arctic Ocean, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I was trying to reach Betty Reed. She’s in a broken
bit of the house at the Steeples. At least some one is.”</p>

<p>“It’s her all right. We drifted down here ’bout an
hour ago. She’s been singin’.”</p>

<p>“Singing?”</p>

<p>“Hymns. ‘How Firm a Foundation,’ an’ like that.
Her an’ the kid an’ Mandy. Say, fellow, it’s been one
heluva night if any one asks you.”</p>

<p>Burt spoke. “Was you tryin’ to swim to where Miss
Betty’s at? You’ve got guts. You didn’t hardly have
a chanct with all the water in the hills a-b’ilin’ down.”</p>

<p>“She can’t be far from here if you heard her sing.”</p>

<p>“Not fur. Mebbe a hundred yards. Mebbe twice
that fur. But I wouldn’t tackle that swim for a million
dollars. I never claimed to be no fish,” Dusty explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Downstream from here?”</p>

<p>“Yep. Over thataway. See the Steeples through the
trees?” The cowboy asked for information: “How
much longer do you reckon the water from yore dam is
gonna keep on comin’?”</p>

<p>“Not much longer now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve sure had a plenty. An’ they call this a
dry country.”</p>

<p>“Wish you’d rub my arms and legs. I’m cold,” the
engineer said.</p>

<p>They massaged him till he glowed.</p>

<p>Tug stepped to the edge of the roof and studied the
current. Presently he spoke to the others. “Much
obliged for your help, boys. I’ll be going now.”</p>

<p>“Going where?” asked Dusty, mouth open from astonishment.</p>

<p>“To the Steeples.”</p>

<p>“You darned son of a gun! What’s got into you, fellow?
You been drowned once to-day—’most. Ain’t
that enough?”</p>

<p>“I can make it there now.”</p>

<p>“Never in the world.” The puncher was emphatic.
“We come through by the skin of our teeth, with a roof
under us. This ain’t no swimmin’-pool. If you know
when you’re well off, you’ll stay where you’re at.”</p>

<p>Tug did not wait to argue the matter. His business
would not wait. He waved a hand and dived from the
roof.</p>

<p>The problem before him was a simple one. Whether
it could be solved, he did not know. While being carried
down, he must fight his way as far across the valley as
possible. He might be swept close to the Steeples and
yet not be able to make a landing. If he failed to do this,
he was lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>He did not stop to see what headway he was making.
All his energy went into the strokes with which he cleft
the water. With every ounce he had he fought to gain
distance. Within a minute or two he would know
whether he had won.</p>

<p>A log careened down. He stopped swimming, in order
not to be struck. The current flung him round. Just
below him were the spires of rock for which he was
making.</p>

<p>In another moment the current was driving him past.
A long pole stuck out into the water from the wreck of
the house and rose and fell with the swell. He caught
hold of this and flung his body across it. Precariously
he clung, several times almost losing his hold. He edged
along it, carefully, until he had worked into the shell of
the house. One wall was gone entirely. Another had
been partially ripped out. Through these openings the
river raced.</p>

<p>Tug let go the telephone pole to which he had been
clinging and swam to the stairway. Here he found a
foothold and sank down, half in the water and half out.
Again the strength had gone out of him.</p>

<p>Then, marvelously, as he lay there panting, the icy
chill clutching at his heart, there came to him a clear,
warm voice raised in a hymn. Betty’s voice! His heart
exulted. He listened to the brave words, gallantly sung.</p>

<p>She was singing, “Hold the Fort.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVIII<br>

<small>BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Do</span> you fink Jesus will come, Betty?” a small voice inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I think he’ll send some one, dear—Dad or Lon or—some
one.”</p>

<p>Ruth considered. “Do you fink he’ll send him in time
for bweakfast? I’m offul hungwy.”</p>

<p>Betty did not know about breakfast, but aloud she
quite confidently thought so. Hope was resurgent in her
heart. The worst of the flood was over. Its level had already
receded two or three inches. She had just discovered
that. Within the past hour its fury had beaten in
and torn away one wall of the house. Another had been
partially destroyed. The shell of a building that was left
could not much longer endure. But she did not believe
that much time would pass before a rescue was attempted.
A few minutes since she had heard Dusty’s
cheerful shout, and, though he was probably marooned
himself, it was a comfort to know that her party was
not the only one in the devastated valley.</p>

<p>“My fry-pans an’ my cook-stove an’ my kitchen are
plumb scattered every which way. I reckon I nevah will
see them no mo’,” Mandy mourned. “An’ las’ week
I done bought dem luminous dishes frum dat peddler.”</p>

<p>“Aluminum, Mandy.”</p>

<p>“Das all right. Luminous or luminum, I ain’ carin’
which. What I wuz sayin’ is—”</p>

<p>Mandy stopped, to let out a yell of fright. A dripping
figure, hatless, coatless, shoeless, was standing at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
head of the stairs. The face was white and haggard.
The body drooped against the door jamb for support.</p>

<p>Straight from Betty’s heart a cry of joy leaped. He
had come to her. Through all the peril of the flood he
had come to her.</p>

<p>“Tug!” she cried, irradiate, and moved to him with
hands outstretched.</p>

<p>He was profoundly touched, but his words reflected
the commonplace of the surface mind. “I’m wet,” he
warned.</p>

<p>She laughed that to scorn, a little hysterically, and
went blindly into his arms, a smirr of mist in her eyes.
All night she had been under a strain, had carried the
responsibility of facing peril for all of them. Now she
cast that burden, without a moment’s hesitation, on
broader shoulders.</p>

<p>His lip trembled. “I was afraid,” he whispered, as
his arms went round her. “Horribly afraid till Dusty
told me he’d heard you singing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m <i>glad</i> you’ve come! I’m <i>glad</i>!” she wailed
softly.</p>

<p>He held her close, as though he were afraid that even
yet malign fate might try to snatch her from him. Beyond
a shadow of a doubt he knew now that if they lived
nothing could keep them apart. She had been right.
The sin that had held him from her was a dead and
shriveled thing. It was no more a part of him than are
discarded horns part of a living stag.</p>

<p>Tug murmured, with emotion, “Thank God! Thank
God!”</p>

<p>Into this stress of feeling Ruth interjected herself.
She saw no reason for being out of the picture.</p>

<p>“Did Jesus send you?” she asked, tugging at his
shirt-sleeve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>He did not quite understand.</p>

<p>Ruth explained, with the impatience of superiority.
“Why, don’chu know? ‘Hold the fort, f’r I am comin’,
Jesus signals still.’ Betty said ’f he didn’t come he’d
send some one.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure God sent him,” Betty said, her voice unsteady.</p>

<p>“Bress de Lawd,” Mandy chimed in. “Now you git
us off’n this yere busted house, Mr. Man, fer I don’ like
no rampagin’ roun’ thisaway on no ocean v’yages.”</p>

<p>Betty explained that he could not get them off just
yet. They would have to wait to be rescued.</p>

<p>“Whaffor he come ’f he ain’ gwine rescue us?” Mandy
sniffed.</p>

<p>The girl smiled into the eyes of her lover. She knew
why he had come, and in his presence by some magic the
fear had dropped from her heart. The current dragging
at their tottering place of refuge could not shake her
sure confidence that all was well with them.</p>

<p>Hollister looked the situation over with the trained
eye of an engineer. He must get them to the rocks before
what was left of the house collapsed. But how? He
could not take them with him through the waves beating
against the sandstone. It was not certain that he
could make a safe landing himself.</p>

<p>But if he could reach the flat ledge above, he might
contrive some kind of bridge out of the dead and down
trees lying there. It would be a hazardous affair, but he
was in no position to be choice about ways and means.</p>

<p>Briefly he explained to Betty his plan. She clung to
him, tremulously, reluctant to let him go.</p>

<p>“Must you?” she murmured, and shuddered at the
black waters rushing past. “Must you go in again?
Couldn’t we just wait here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“’Fraid not, dear. You feel how the house is shaking.
It can’t last long. We’ve got to reach the rocks.”</p>

<p>“It’s been pretty awful, Tug. When the wall was
swept out, I thought—” She shook that appalling
memory out of her mind and smiled at him, shyly, adorably.
“I’m not afraid as long as you’re here.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” he reassured. “I think I can do it,
Betty.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I help?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Knot together two sheets to make a rope.
I’ll need it later.”</p>

<p>He dropped from a window, found himself caught in
an irresistible tide that swept him away like a chip. It
was all over in a moment. He was whirled round and
dashed into the rocks. The impact knocked the breath
out of him. He clung, desperately, to a jutting spar of
sandstone, hardly conscious of what he was doing.</p>

<p>The life went out of him. When he came to consciousness,
he lay on the shelf, feet and legs still in the water.
He noticed that his head was bleeding and for an instant
wondered what it was all about.</p>

<p>Betty’s voice reached him. “Tug! Tug!”</p>

<p>She was leaning out of the window of the tossing
house.</p>

<p>He rose and waved a hand. Strength flowed back to
him in waves. The haze lifted from his brain. He visualized
the problem of the bridge and set about meeting it.</p>

<p>The dead trees on the ledge were young pines. They
had been broken off from the roots, probably blown from
the crevices because they were insufficiently rooted.
He dragged one to the edge of the sloping surface of the
boulder and raised it till it was upright.</p>

<p>“Back from the window, Betty,” he shouted.</p>

<p>Her head and shoulders disappeared. He balanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
the tree-trunk carefully, measured the distance again
with his eye, and let it fall toward the house. The end of
it crashed through the window panes and landed on the
casing.</p>

<p>Tug dragged forward a second pole, shouted a warning
to Betty once more, and balanced the pine carefully.
A second later it toppled forward, urged by a slight
push, and the butt dropped into the casing beside the
others.</p>

<p>On this frail bridge Tug crept on hands and knees
toward the building. The house tilted down and back.
The end of the logs slipped. Betty clung to them, desperately,
while Hollister edged forward.</p>

<p>“I’ll take that rope,” he told the girl.</p>

<p>Mandy handed out the sheets. As the bridge swayed
and dipped, he knotted the linen round the logs, tying
them together in two places. It was a hazardous business,
but he got through with it safely.</p>

<p>A few seconds later he was in the bedroom.</p>

<p>“Ruth first,” said Betty.</p>

<p>Tug nodded. “Tie her to my back. She might get
frightened and let loose.”</p>

<p>The child whimpered as he crept out upon the logs.</p>

<p>“Betty’s coming too in a minute,” her sister called
cheerfully. “Just shut your eyes, Ruthie, and hang
tight.”</p>

<p>The narrow suspension bridge swung dizzily with
every lift of the racing flood. Tug inched along, his feet
locked together beneath the water that reached for him.
Once he lost his balance from a lurch of the logs, but he
managed to recover himself. Ruth screamed.</p>

<p>“All right, dear,” he told her, and presently was pulling
himself upon the rocks.</p>

<p>Hollister left the little girl there and recrossed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
building. Betty crawled out on the bridge, the man
close behind her.</p>

<p>She looked down, and was appalled. The pour of the
stream that was so close carried the power of a mountain
river in flood. Her body swayed. She could never get
across—never in the world.</p>

<p>The voice of her lover came, strong and comforting.
“Steady, Bess. We’re all right.”</p>

<p>His assurance went through her veins like wine. Tug
was behind her. Of course, they would reach the rocks.</p>

<p>The logs dipped almost to the water at the middle.
A monster that seemed to be alive dragged at her
feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tug!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Keep going. We’re almost across.”</p>

<p>And presently they were, safe on the slanting sandstone
shelf.</p>

<p>He returned for Mandy.</p>

<p>“I cayn’t nevah git acrost on that there rickety rack,”
she moaned. “I’d bust dem poles spang in two.”</p>

<p>Hollister was not sure himself that they would hold
her weight, but he knew that before many minutes the
house was going to break up. He coaxed and urged her
to the attempt, and after she began the crossing he
clung to the end of the bridge with all his weight.</p>

<p>How Mandy got across none of them ever knew. She
stopped twice to announce that she could not do it, but
after more exhortation continued edging along. To the
very moment when Betty reached a hand to her, she insisted
that she was going to be drownded.</p>

<p>Not three minutes after Tug had crossed to the rock
shelf, the shell of the house shivered and collapsed. It
went out with a rush, and presently was nothing but a
lot of floating planks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>Betty watched it go, with trembling lips. “If you
hadn’t come,” she murmured.</p>

<p>His soul went out to her in swift response. “I had to
come. It wasn’t chance. That’s how it was meant to
be. Why not? Why wouldn’t I be near enough to come
when you needed me?”</p>

<p>She caught his hand. “You dear boy,” she breathed.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody like you—nobody I ever met,” he
cried in a whisper, as lovers have done since Adam first
wooed Eve. “Could any one have done more for me
than you? Your faith rebuilt my life. If I’m ever anything,
I owe it to you. And now—the greatest gift of
all. Why to me? Why not to Merrick, far more worthy
of you?”</p>

<p>In her smile was the world-old wisdom Leonardo has
expressed in his Mona Lisa.</p>

<p>“Love doesn’t go by merit, does it? I wonder if Justin
isn’t too worthy. He’s perfect in himself—complete.
He doesn’t need me.”</p>

<p>“God knows I need you, if that’s a reason,” he said
humbly. “But it’s not fair to you.”</p>

<p>“Was it Justin who swam through the flood to save
me?” she asked softly, her face aglow.</p>

<p>“He’s doing a much more sensible thing—building
a raft to get you ashore.”</p>

<p>“Who wants her lover to do the sensible thing?”
She turned to him impulsively, warm, tender, luminous,
a rapt young thing caught in a surge of generous emotion.
“I’d want mine to do just what you did—come
through water or through fire instantly when I needed
you. I’d love you now, if I never had before.”</p>

<p>“And if Merrick had come?”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t come. It wouldn’t be Justin to do
that—to fling his life away on a thousandth chance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
Don’t you see, Tug? He doesn’t tread the mountain-tops—and
you do.”</p>

<p>“I see you’re always giving. If I could only wipe the
slate out, Betty—begin my life over again to-day,”
he said wistfully.</p>

<p>In her deep, soft eyes a dream lingered. “That’s just
what I want—to begin everything with you. It’s silly,
but I’m jealous of all those years when I didn’t have
you—of all the sorrows and joys you’ve had, of the
girls and the men you’ve known—because I can’t
share them with you. I’ve got to know all you think
and share all your hopes. If you ever think, ‘She’s
just my wife—’”</p>

<p>“Never that. Always, ‘She’s my wife,’” he promised.</p>

<p>“As long as you say it that way, Tug,” she murmured,
and clung to him with a little feminine savagery of possession.</p>

<p>Ruth, impatient at being ignored, again claimed
attention.</p>

<p>“Talk to me, too,” she ordered.</p>

<p>Tug caught her small hand in his. “Of course, we’ll
talk to little sister.”</p>

<p>“Are you my big brother?” she asked.</p>

<p>Betty stooped and snatched the child to her. “He’s
going to be,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Upon this Ruth set the seal of her approval. “Goody,
I like him. An’ he’ll get me heaps ’n’ heaps of tandy.
More’n anybody.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIX<br>

<small>THE TURN OF A CROOKED TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jake Prowers</span> had intended, while the work of destruction
was under way, to return to his ranch and let it
take its course. The body of Cig would be found, and
the tramp would be blamed for the disaster. It would
be remembered that he had already tried once to blow
up the workers in the tunnel.</p>

<p>The cowman knew that public opinion would not hold
him blameless. He would be suspected of instigating the
crime, but, with Cig out of the way, nothing could be
proved. There would not be the least evidence that
could touch him. He had done a good job in getting
rid of the New York crook. Moreover, he had not lifted
a hand against the man. Was he to blame because a
drunken loafer lay down and deliberately went to sleep
where a charge of dynamite would shortly blow him
up?</p>

<p>The wise course, Prowers knew, was to retire for a
time to the background and to be greatly surprised when
he was told that the dam had gone out. But there was in
him a desire stronger than prudence. He wanted to see
the flood racing through the Quarter Circle D E and its
waters being wasted on the Flat Tops which they were
to have reclaimed. Half his pleasure in the evil thing
he had done would be lost if he could not be on the
ground to gloat over Clint Reed and Merrick.</p>

<p>Before the night had fully spent itself, he was on his
way to the Quarter Circle D E. The sun was almost up
over the hilltops by the time he looked down from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
rim of the little valley upon the havoc he had wrought.
The ranch buildings were all gone, though he could see
battered remnants of them in the swirling stream.
Fences had been rooted out. A young orchard below
the house was completely submerged.</p>

<p>The destruction was even greater than he had anticipated.
It had not occurred to him that any lives would
be lost, but he judged now that the men at the ranch
had probably been drowned.</p>

<p>His interest drew him closer, to a point from which he
could see the lower part of the valley. He made here
two discoveries. Three men were out in the flooded
district on the roof of a low building. Another group,
on the shore line below him, were building two rafts,
evidently with a rescue in mind.</p>

<p>One of the workmen caught sight of Prowers and called
to him. Jake decided it was better to go down, since he
had been recognized.</p>

<p>He glanced at the dam engineer and subdued a cackle.
It might easily be possible to go too far just now.</p>

<p>“You move yore reservoir down here last night, Merrick?”
he asked maliciously. “Wisht I’d ’a’ known.
I’d kinda liked to ’a’ seen you bringin’ it down.”</p>

<p>Merrick said nothing. He continued to trim an edge
from a plank with a hatchet. But though he did not look
at Prowers his mind was full of him. He had been thinking
about him all morning. Why had the dam gone out?
Had it been dynamited? Was this the work of him and
his hangers-on?</p>

<p>“’Seems like you might ’a’ let a fellow know,” the
cowman complained in his high, thin voice.</p>

<p>Black appeared, dragging a plank he had salvaged.
He looked at Prowers, and instantly his mind was full of
suspicion. He had known the old man thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“’Lo, Don,” continued Jake with an amiable edge
of irony. “Always doing some neighborly good deed,
ain’t you? You’ll be a Boy Scout by an’ by if you don’t
watch out.”</p>

<p>Black looked at him with level eyes. “Howcome you
here so early, Jake?”</p>

<p>“Me! On my way to Wild Horse. Come to that,
I’m some surprised to see you, Don.”</p>

<p>“I been workin’ for Mr. Merrick,” the range rider
said curtly. “That’s why I’m here. But mostly when
you go to Wild Horse you don’t ramble round by the
Quarter Circle, Jake. I’m kinda wonderin’ how you
happened round this way.”</p>

<p>“Huntin’ for a two-year-old reported strayed over
thisaway. Lucky I came. I’ll be able to help.” He
turned to Merrick unctuously, his bleached eyes mildly
solicitous. “If the’s a thing on earth I can do, why
I’m here to go to it.”</p>

<p>The men were carrying one of the rafts to the edge
of the water. Merrick gave his whole attention to the
business of manning and equipping it.</p>

<p>“This raft heads for the Steeples,” he announced.
“Two volunteers wanted to steer it.”</p>

<p>Black stopped chewing tobacco. “How about you
’n’ me, Jake?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>For once Prowers was taken at disadvantage. “I
ain’t any sailor, Don.”</p>

<p>“None of us are. But you offered to help. ’Course, if
you’re scared.”</p>

<p>The cattleman’s head moved forward, his eyes narrowed.
“Did you say scared?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Last time I seen you, Jake, you was guessin’
I had a yellow streak. I’m wonderin’ that about you
now. I’m aimin’ to go on this boat. Are you?” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
range rider’s gaze bored into the eyes of the man he had
served so long. It was chill and relentless as steel.</p>

<p>Prowers was no coward, but he had not the least
intention of voyaging across the flood in so frail a
craft.</p>

<p>“Too old, Don. I ain’t strong as some o’ these young
bucks. You go on, an’ when you come back we’ll settle
about that yellow streak for good an’ all.”</p>

<p>The raft set out on its perilous journey. A young
surveyor had offered to go as the second member of the
crew.</p>

<p>Pegs had been driven into the edges of the raft for
rowlocks. The oars had been hastily fashioned out of
planking.</p>

<p>The float drifted into the rapid water and was caught
by the current. Black and his companion pulled lustily
to make headway across stream. There was a minute of
desperate struggle before the craft swung round, driven
by the force of water tumbling pell-mell down.</p>

<p>A rowlock snapped. Black’s oar was dragged from
his hand. A log crashed into the raft and buckled it up.
Caught by a cross-tide, the two who had been flung into
the water were swept into an eddy. They swam and
clambered ashore.</p>

<p>It had not been five minutes since Black had embarked
on this adventure, but, as he moved up the
shore toward the little group of men he had left, he saw
that something unexpected had developed.</p>

<p>Prowers was in the saddle and he had his gun out.
It was threatening Merrick’s group of rescuers. The
cattleman’s thin, high voice came clear to the range
rider.</p>

<p>“Don’t you touch me! Don’t you! I’ll fill you full
of lead sure’s you move an inch, Merrick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Then, swiftly, he swung his horse round and galloped
away.</p>

<p>Out of the hubbub of explanation Black gathered the
facts. The man whom Prowers had lured from the dam
with a message that his wife was worse had stopped
for later information at a ranch house on the way
down. He had telephoned his house and talked with
his wife. He was perplexed, but relieved. After an
hour’s chat at the ranch, he had headed for the dam
and reached the scene in time to identify Prowers as
he left.</p>

<p>A minute ago he had arrived and told what he knew.
The engineer had accused Prowers point-blank of the
crime. His men had talked of lynching, and Prowers had
fled.</p>

<p>Black did not discuss the situation. He returned to
camp, saddled a horse, and took from his roll of bedding
a revolver. Five minutes later he was jogging into the
hills. A day of settlement had come between him and
the man who had deflected him from the straight and
well-worn trails of life.</p>

<p>He knew the size of his job. Jake was a bad man with
a gun, swift as chain lightning, deadly accurate in aim.
It was not likely that he would let himself be taken
alive. The chances were that any man who engaged in
a duel with him would stay on the field of battle. Don
accepted this likelihood quietly, grimly. He meant to
get Jake Prowers, to bring him in alive if possible, dead,
if he must.</p>

<p>The range rider had no qualms of conscience. Prowers
had probably drowned several innocent people, very
likely Betty and her little sister among them. The
fellow was dangerous as a mad wolf. The time had
come to blot him out. He, Don Black, was the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
that ought to do it. If Jake surrendered, good enough;
he would take him to Wild Horse. If not—</p>

<p>So his simple mind reasoned foggily. He was essentially
a deputy sheriff, though, of course, he had not had
time to get Daniels to appoint him. That was merely a
formality, anyhow.</p>

<p>Don rode straight to the Circle J P ranch. He swung
from the saddle and dropped the lines in front of the
house. As he did so, he noticed two buzzards circling
high in the sky.</p>

<p>Prowers must have seen him coming, for when Don
turned toward the porch the little man was standing
there watching him. Black moved forward, spurs
jingling.</p>

<p>His eyes did not lift from those of Prowers. At the
foot of the steps he stopped. “I’ve come after you,
Jake,” he said evenly.</p>

<p>The skim-milk eyes in the leathery face narrowed.
They were hard and shining pin-points of wary challenge.</p>

<p>“What for, Don?”</p>

<p>“For blowin’ up the dam, you yellow wolf.”</p>

<p>“Then come a-shootin’.”</p>

<p>The forty-fives blazed. The roar of them filled the
air. Across the narrow range between the two men
bullets stabbed with deadly precision.</p>

<p>Black swayed on his feet. He knew he was shot
through and through in several places, that he could
count his life in minutes, perhaps in seconds. Through
the smoke rifts he could see the crouching figure flinging
death at him. Still firing, he sank to his knees. He
could no longer lift the revolver, and as his body
plunged to the ground the last cartridge was exploded
into the sod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>Down the steps toward him rolled the shrunken form
of his foe, slowly, without volition, every muscle lax.
They lay close to each other, only their eyes alive to
glare defiance till the film of dissolution shadowed them.</p>

<p>They must have passed out within a few seconds of
each other.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XL<br>

<small>BETTY DISCOVERS WHY SHE IS YOUNG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the house Tug had brought matches with him.
He gathered pine boughs and lit a fire upon the rock
slab. The warmth of it went through them and restored
their diminished vitality.</p>

<p>“The water’s going down fast,” Betty said. “See
the rock. It’s several inches lower.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Merrick will be here soon.”</p>

<p>Except for Ruth and Mandy, the girl did not care
how long he was. She was young, and in love. Beside
her sat the man who was to be her mate. A flash of the
eye brought happiness. A touch of the hand thrilled.</p>

<p>Even when she did not look at him, she was acutely
conscious of his presence. Without turning her head
she saw the line of the razor stroke where the golden
down ceased on his tanned cheek, was aware of the
gallant set of the fine head on strong shoulders. Oh, it
was good to be near him, to know that out of all the
millions of men in the world she had found her mate.
There was in her a strange, a primitive, instinct to accept
his leadership, a desire to be subject to his wishes
and commands.</p>

<p>She smiled. This was not like her. Perhaps it was a
merely temporary aberration.</p>

<p>“Are we really all alike?” she asked herself, trying to
understand this love-complex that already was changing
her point of view. “We want to be free, want to
express ourselves. We’re thinking of nothing else.
And then—enter a man. Our house of cards comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
toppling down, and we don’t care a bit. Sometimes, of
course, he isn’t the right man. Then—tragedy, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>The young philosopher, looking at her hero, was very
sure he was the right man. Her certainty went beyond
evidence, beyond faith.</p>

<p>Merrick’s raft reached them about noon. He was
admirable in the rôle of rescuer. Efficiency showed in
everything he did, even to the sandwiches, and coffee
in a thermos bottle, which he had not forgotten to bring.</p>

<p>“Where’s Dad?” asked Betty, between bites.</p>

<p>“He and Forbes were at First View last night.”</p>

<p>“Does he know we’re safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s headed for home now.”</p>

<p>Within the hour they were back at the Diamond
Bar K. Clint drove up a few minutes later, Forbes
beside him.</p>

<p>The cattleman took his children in his arms and held
them close. He could not talk without breaking down.
He dared not put his feeling into words. They had come
back to him from the dead—these two. Inside of him
a river of unshed tears flowed.</p>

<p>Betty left him making over Ruth and slipped into the
next room where some one was waiting for her. Lon
Forbes was telling Hollister some news.</p>

<p>“... Jake’s men found ’em there dead, not three
feet apart. Both guns empty. Four bullets in Jake’s
body, five in Don’s—an’ most any one of ’em a fatal
wound. They were that game they wouldn’t quit.
It takes a heap o’ killin’ to finish an old-timer, I’ll say.”</p>

<p>Tremulously, Betty moved forward. “Who?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Lon told her. “I’m sorry about Black, but Jake sure
had it comin’,” he finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>The foreman passed into the other room to tell Clint
the news.</p>

<p>In a hushed voice Betty talked the tragedy over with
Tug. The swiftness with which Nemesis had overtaken
and obliterated Prowers was appalling to her. She had
a momentary vision, vivid and amazingly sure, of God
in the shadows passing judgment on the sins of men. It
was as though they were back in the days of the old
Hebrew prophets when the hand of the Lord stretched
out and laid itself upon wicked men for their punishment
when the measure of their time was full.</p>

<p>“He tried to stand above the law in this valley,”
Hollister told her. “He wanted to stop progress—said
there shouldn’t be any dam to reclaim the Flat
Tops for settlers. Merrick will rebuild it. The land will
be watered. Your ranch will be good as ever in three
months. And he’ll be buried and forgotten.”</p>

<p>“And poor Don Black?” she whispered. “Poor Don,
who never had a chance in this world, or, if he had one,
muddled it so badly?”</p>

<p>He could only hope that Don had gone to a better-ordered
world where circumstances did not dominate
good intentions.</p>

<p>Betty’s sense of tragedy lingered just now no longer
than a cinema picture. The life urge in her clamored for
expression. No world could be a sad one with her and
Tug in it.</p>

<p>“Shall I go in and tell your father now?” the young
man asked.</p>

<p>“Soon.” She made a rustling little motion toward him
and found herself in his arms. “Isn’t it splendid, boy?
To-day’s the best ever, and to-morrow will be better
than to-day—oh, heaps better—and after that all
the years forever and ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>He looked into the deep lustrous eyes of his straight
slim girl. What a wife she would be! How eager and
provocative, this white flame of youth so simple and so
complex! Her happiness now would be in his hands.
The responsibility awed him, filled him with a sense of
solemnity.</p>

<p>“Forever is a long time,” he said, smiling, and quoted
a stanza of magazine verse they had lately read together.</p>

<p>It began, “How far will you go with me, my love?”
Close-held in his arms, Betty answered without a moment
of hesitation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“She smiled at the stile with a sweet disdain;</div>
<div class="indent">She scoffed at the bridge and the great oak tree;</div>
<div class="verse">And looked me full in the eyes and said:</div>
<div class="indent">‘I will go to the end of the lane with thee.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The door of the inner room opened and Clint stood
on the threshold. “Hello!” he said, surprised.</p>

<p>Betty disengaged herself, blushing. “He’s decided
to take me after all, Dad,” she said demurely.</p>

<p>“Hmp! Has he? Kinda looks that way.” Clint
gripped Hollister’s hand till it hurt. It was the best
he could do just now to show the gratitude he felt for
what this man had done.</p>

<p>“That’s not quite the way I put it, sir,” Tug said.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t matter how you put it, boy. It’ll be her
say-so from now on. Don’t I know her? Hasn’t she
bossed me scandalous since she was knee-high to a
gosling?”</p>

<p>“Now, Dad, you’re giving me a bad name,” Betty
protested, hugging her father.</p>

<p>“If he ain’t man enough to stand some bossing, he’d
better quit right now before he says, ‘I do.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“<i>He</i> likes being bossed, Dad,” Betty announced, and
the imps of deviltry were kicking up their heels in her
eyes. “Don’t you, Tug?”</p>

<p>Hollister looked at the girl and smiled. “I’ll say I
do,” he admitted.</p>

<p><span class="u">THE BARON OF DIAMOND TAIL</span></p>

<p>The Elk Mountain Cattle Co. had not paid a dividend in years;
so Edgar Barrett, fresh from the navy, was sent West to see what
was wrong at the ranch. The tale of this tenderfoot outwitting the
buckaroos at their own play will sweep you into the action of this
salient western novel.</p>

<p><span class="u">THE BONDBOY</span></p>

<p>Joe Newbolt, bound out by force of family conditions to work for
a number of years, is accused of murder and circumstances are
against him. His mouth is sealed; he cannot, as a gentleman, utter
the words that would clear him. A dramatic, romantic tale of intense
interest.</p>

<p><span class="u">CLAIM NUMBER ONE</span></p>

<p>Dr. Warren Slavens drew claim number one, which entitled him
to first choice of rich lands on an Indian reservation in Wyoming. It
meant a fortune; but before he established his ownership he had a
hard battle with crooks and politicians.</p>

<p><span class="u">THE DUKE OF CHIMNEY BUTTE</span></p>

<p>When Jerry Lambert, “the Duke,” attempts to safeguard the
cattle ranch of Vesta Philbrook from thieving neighbors, his work is
appallingly handicapped because of Grace Kerr, one of the chief agitators,
and a deadly enemy of Vesta’s. A stirring tale of brave deeds,
gun-play and a love that shines above all.</p>

<p><span class="u">THE FLOCKMASTER OF POISON CREEK</span></p>

<p>John Mackenzie trod the trail from Jasper to the great sheep
country where fortunes were being made by the flock-masters.
Shepherding was not a peaceful pursuit in those bygone days. Adventure
met him at every turn—there is a girl of course—men fight
their best fights for a woman—it is an epic of the sheeplands.</p>

<p><span class="u">THE LAND OF LAST CHANCE</span></p>

<p>Jim Timberlake and Capt. David Scott waited with restless
thousands on the Oklahoma line for the signal to dash across the
border. How the city of Victory arose overnight on the plains, how
people savagely defended their claims against the “sooners;” how
good men and bad played politics, makes a strong story of growth
and American initiative.</p>

<p><span class="u">TRAIL’S END</span></p>

<p>Ascalon was the end of the trail for thirsty cowboys who gave
vent to their pent-up feelings without restraint. Calvin Morgan was
not concerned with its wickedness until Seth Craddock’s malevolence
directed itself against him. He did not emerge from the maelstrom
until he had obliterated every vestige of lawlessness, and assured
himself of the safety of a certain dark-eyed girl.</p>
